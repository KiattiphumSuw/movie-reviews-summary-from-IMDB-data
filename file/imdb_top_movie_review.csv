1. Oppenheimer,8/10,"A challenging watch to be sure, but a worthwhile one.",
1. Oppenheimer,9/10,Murphy is exceptional,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch."
1. Oppenheimer,7/10,Quality but exhausting,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.

I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.

All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.

1. Oppenheimer,10/10,A brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws,"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.

During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.

On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.

In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.

Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.

For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.

The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.

It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.

Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.

As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.

I rate it a perfect 10/10."
1. Oppenheimer,10/10,Nolan delivers a powerfull biopic that shows the dark side of human nature!,"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!

Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!

The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!

The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!

Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!"
1. Oppenheimer,8/10,"Nolan touches greatness, falls slightly short",
1. Oppenheimer,10/10,A Masterpiece,"I may consider myself lucky to be alive to watch Christopher Nolan Works which get better by years.

Oppenheimer is - with no doubt- going to be one of the best movies in the history. Amazing cinematography, Exceptional acting and terrifying Soundtracks.

All the cast are great from cilian Murphy who is going for the oscar with this role to Rupert Downey jr and Emily blunt and finally rami malik who has small scenes but you will never forget them.

I didn't watch it in Imax as i couldn't wait and ran to the nearest cinema but now i will sure book an imax ticket.

Don't waste any time, book your ticket and Go watch it.. NOW."
1. Oppenheimer,10/10,And the Oscar goes to...,"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.

This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.

Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.

Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end."
1. Oppenheimer,8/10,Is it just me ?,"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8.

1. Oppenheimer,6/10,"Breaks all filmmaklng rules, but not in a good way",
1. Oppenheimer,10/10,Another Cinematic Masterpiece by Christopher Nolan,"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.

Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.

The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.

Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.

The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.

I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon."
1. Oppenheimer,6/10,This just might be as interesting as this topic can get,
1. Oppenheimer,4/10,Disappointing,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.

For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.

We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.

Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?

What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.

We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.

Let's be fair and give something it's due. A 10 used to meant perfection, not just the glare or the sparkles. Remember not all that shines is gold."
1. Oppenheimer,9/10,Exceptional storytelling and Genius Cinametography,"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.

1. Oppenheimer,8/10,This movie is the bomb!,"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.

All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.

My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.

I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so."
1. Oppenheimer,8/10,Technically superb but...,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.

There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.

The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.

I wish there were more moments like that...

If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.

However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.

To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.

8.4/10."
1. Oppenheimer,8/10,"Murphy is Amazing, But Downey Jr Steals The Show","I just got out of Oppenheimer

I have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.

But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.

Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.

Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.

Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.

I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.

This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toilet

For me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in. It reminded me of Oliver Stone's JFK, which I love."
1. Oppenheimer,10/10,FUTURE CLASSIC and EXTREMELY IMPORTANT MOVIE FOR THE PRESENT DAY,"Authentic audio-visual journey to the era of the birth of atomic genesis, which both terrifies and astonishes you with its nonlinear storytelling thanks to Christopher Nolan's masterful approach to direction and screenplay! The pacing of the movie is simply brilliant especially in the moments where the main theme by Ludwig Göransson kicks in! It's a future classic that will not leave you indifferent and will immerse you in the Homeric biography of the notorious scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer! Definitely a 10/10 for the artistic contribution to the history and art of audio-visual media depicting an extraordinarily important event for humanity and the present day!

1. Oppenheimer,8/10,"Good movie, but don't let Nolan fans fool you.",
1. Oppenheimer,6/10,"Half an Hour too long, misses the point","Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.

The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.

So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.

Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia."
1. Oppenheimer,10/10,Stunning - put it in a time capsule,"My Review - Oppenheimer My Rating Ten plus 10/10 In Cinemas now

If there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.

This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.

Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.

I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .

Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.

In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.

The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.

The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .

After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.

The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.

The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.

The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.

The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.

I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet."
1. Oppenheimer,7/10,I Wish I Could Say I Had A Blast,
1. Oppenheimer,5/10,An unpopular opinion from a die-hard Nolan fan,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.

Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.

Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.

While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.

This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.

I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.

If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day. I'm endlessly sad that I have to wait another three years for a new Nolan movie, and hope that he switches back to something more intriguing than the life of a scientist.

3. Pulp Fiction,10/10,The masterpiece without a message,"One of the early scenes in ""Pulp Fiction"" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, ""Pulp Fiction"" wouldn't be ""Pulp Fiction."" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.

It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. ""Pulp Fiction,"" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or ""art about art."" It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.

The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.

Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, ""Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,"" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia's statement to Vincent, ""That's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.""

What is the movie's purpose exactly? I'm not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn't just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it's a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.

There's a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.

Still, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really ""about"" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind."
3. Pulp Fiction,10/10,A masterpiece of screenwriting,"This is Tarantino's masterpiece, there's no other way to say it. It has arguably one of the smartest scripts I've ever seen. The story, which is non-linear, is so well constructed it takes several viewings to grasp it all. The movie doesn't seem to be about any spesific thing, but there is a subtle hint of redemption as a central theme. The characters and preformances in this movie are practically perfect. This is still one of the best performances I've seen from Sam Jackson, and it's an outrage he didn't win an Oscar. Each scene has its own unique flavour and charm, every segment has its own arc while also tying into the main plot. The comedy is great, the serious moments are great, every word of dialogue is exciting despite seemingly not having any reason to exist. This movie is just such a great time, and I recommend it to everyone who loves movies. I cannot think of a single genuine flaw with it, and it will remain one of my favorite movies for a long time.

3. Pulp Fiction,10/10,The rebirth of a genre – and film history,"I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as stylish, cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone when I first saw it in 1994. What really pulled me in right from the start is what we've now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the dialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines – it's a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if it's just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then there's the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with 'Pulp Fiction'. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of ""chapters"" – there is so much playful creativity at play here, it's just a pure joy to watch.

If you're a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats – and inspiration from them - went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino of copying or even ""stealing"" from other film-makers I can only say: There has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch Tarantino's masterpiece today, it's impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies - especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. It's – well: it's 'Pulp Fiction'. 10 stars out of 10.

3. Pulp Fiction,10/10,My Favourite Movie,"Pulp Fiction is the most original, rule breaking film I have ever seen. Instead of following the widely used 3 act structure, Pulp Fiction makes up its own and while the 3 stories may seem completely disconnected at first, once you look closely you can find the underlying themes that they all share. Anyone who says that the movie lacks focus or has no meaning hasn't analysed enough. I highly recommend this film since it is number one on my list of my favourite movies of all time.

3. Pulp Fiction,10/10,One of the Funniest Movies Ever,"It took fifteen years and a subscription to Netflix to finally get around to seeing this film. It was well worth the wait. If all one were to see is the byplay between Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, it would be worth the price of admission. But this is only part of the incredible effect this film has. I don't even like gore in movies; I avoid it. But Tarentino weaves a culture of violence where there is actual humanity. We care about these bad guys. There is scene after scene of people being pushed to the limit. The very idea that the boxer, played by Bruce Willis, would risk everything to retrieve a watch that has been transported on two occasions, shove up someone's ass, is amazing. And very, very funny. I can't begin to list all the wonderful scenes. The opening dialogue is incredible as Trovolta and Jackson are on their way to do a hit. They have virtually no respect for human life, yet they, themselves, are very human. The date scene with Uma Thurman with the adrenaline shot. The crazy's in the pawn shop. And, the effort to clean up the car after blowing away a kid in the back seat, the issue being that a guys wife would come home and be very unhappy to find a dead body and a blood filled car in the garage. It sounds horrible and makes me sound sick. I found Fargo to be a hilarious film as well. Is there something wrong with me?"
3. Pulp Fiction,10/10,Not overrated at all,"Before I saw this I assumed it was probably overrated. I was wrong. It lives up to and surpasses its reputation in pretty much every way. I would definitely recommend.

3. Pulp Fiction,9/10,Pulp Fiction,
3. Pulp Fiction,10/10,"Tarantino's Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World !!!","This is a tour de force of brilliantly precise screen writing, perfect acting, precise camera-work, perfect directing and world class dialogue writing. 'Pulp Fiction' is Tarantino's carnival of funny, but equally abrasive nihilism. This is a film which has a surprisingly firm backbone of morality beneath the crazy and deranged surface. Tarantino is constantly on the lookout for characters who make a choice to turn their back on their meaningless lives of nihilistic violence and look for honour and a purpose. The characters who make that choice are allowed to ride off into the sunset, while the characters who decide to not change and stick to their meaningless cyclical lives of never-ending crime and violence are burdened with unenviable fates. There is a method to the madness. Tarantino makes the film and the characters infinitely rich. However while doing all this, he never stops having fun. There are endless film references, pop culture references and other stuff that signifies the film's self- consciousness which constantly make the viewer feel the fact that they are watching a film, a piece of fiction through Tarantino's eyes and not anything attached to reality.

Some people tend to trivialise the structure of the screenplay by calling it a gimmick. But as far as I'm concerned the structure of the screenplay is essential and indispensable in the context of the narrative and in the context of how Tarantino wants to drive home the themes that he is exploring. In a nutshell........ yeah, 'Pulp Fiction' is a masterpiece, it's a bad mother#*%@er."
3. Pulp Fiction,10/10,One of the Best Film's I've Seen In A LONG Time... and still is,"Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is a terrific film. It also gets better with each viewing, especially if one of those happens to be on a big theatrical screen where all of the BIG compositions get bigger and more detailed. How much else is there to talk about it after all these years? It's filled with dynamite, sudden and always interesting action, great and naturally clever dialogue, and memorable characters. Also, the acting is always something to behold as by turns straightforward, over the top, subtle, and just downright menacing and spot-on. The directing is one of the strongest that we've seen from Tarantino, as he makes his choices in pacing with shots in unconventional ways but never in a way that would be distracting. And writing, already noted, has been copied by many, and only equaled by a select few.

The dance sequence. Samuel L. Jackson's superlative monologuing. It has loyalty among low lifes, and many other odd characters that are all bad and not one is a villain or hero. And somehow even after years of parody and terrible rip-offs, it holds its own and- as one can say after seeing it at a midnight screening- holds its audience as much as it had the countless times before they saw it (or if they are, the first time). The first time you're surprised, the second time you look for the clues or other ambiguity, and then the third time you laugh you head off. The fourth time... I'll leave to you."
3. Pulp Fiction,7/10,A Bit Over Rated But Good,"I did like pulp fiction to a degree - that is mainly because I love the casting in it: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman.

The movie is a good crime thriller that all movie lovers should watch. And in some ways the movie does live up to it's hype because the story is well written and acted out good too.

But, to me, the movie is overrated. It seems that *some* of the people that loves this movie will act/talk like it's the only movie worth watching - like it is the ""King of Films"". Yes Pulp Fiction is a very good movie but there are so many great movies to enjoy watching - not just this film.

3. Pulp Fiction,8/10,"Fun cult film, tad overrated","Conflicted on this one. I like a lot of elements of it, the characters are (mostly) really compelling and interesting. I think some of the ""Segments"" are a lot stronger than others. I think that the first part of Bruce Willis's story is just... bland. I didn't find it very interesting or compelling. It gets interesting though. The first and last are by far my favourite, but for the most part it's pretty strong. I do think this film is slightly overrated. That's not to say that it isn't good, but I think a lot of people think it is a whole lot better then it is. The film is acted well and I enjoyed all the action, not to mention the comedy in this film caught me by surprise. I found it really hilarious. I see why everyone had/has a crush on Uma Thurman now, she really is deserving of the main character on the cover. I also remembered how much I like long shots. I think they allow exposition to be delivered in a way that is more pleasing to the audience. Overall, good crime flick with some great comedy and action but a tad overrated. 7-8/10.

3. Pulp Fiction,10/10,Everything that Once upon a time in Hollywood wasn't.,"Pulp Fiction is pretty much Once upon a time in Hollywood, but better in every regard.

Pulp Fiction encapsulated and defined the 90s, that's what this movie was. A piece of art, not a movie.

This movie is all about the characters and the actors, not any plot. That's why I would rate the movie as follows

1. Characters 11

2. Acting 10

3. Plot 7

4. Cinematography 10

5. World building 10

We have stellar characters and acting. Cinematography is also amazing, it really sucks you in and the world building really makes you fell like you are in the 90s."
3. Pulp Fiction,10/10,"Ah, so by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to be a filthy animal. Is that true?","It kind of feels redundant trying to write a review for Pulp Fiction as it approaches its 20th birthday. As a film it needs no introduction, it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, won a BAFTA and Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (Tarantino), and garnered a whole host of other awards and nominations. Box office beef was meaty and its reputation even now shows no sign of waning (it currently sits at number 4 on the IMDb top 100 list), it is by definition one cool MOFO of a movie, a picture loved by a cross section of demographics. But why?

Pulp Fiction oozes humour, romance, violence and stylish flourishes. It remains compulsive viewing throughout; even as it threatens to get submerged in its own complex structure. Film lover Tarantino takes a number of low life and unfortunate characters from Los Angeles, mainlines then with movie clichés, and then amazingly breathes new life into them. It knowingly winks at B movies from the past yet always remains fresh on its own terms. I myself having just revisited the film after a 5 year gap can attest to just how well it holds up, laughing at the dialogue, perched on the edge of the seat as violence starts to rumble, and yes, singing along with that most catchy of soundtracks.

Yet for all its flashiness and hipster chattering, there's one thing that often gets overlooked when talk of Pulp Fiction's greatness arises. That of a basic human urge to survive or find salvation, Tarantino's main characters may be bottom feeders or scummy operatives of the underworld, but there's love and needing beating slowly in its dark heart before the drugs and violence take a hold. Neat trick that from Tarantino, brilliant in fact. 10/10"
3. Pulp Fiction,10/10,Brilliantly constructed.,"""Pulp Fiction"" is a brilliantly crafted film. The many separate vignettes all are quite compelling and fit together wonderfully. And, on top of that, the script and acting are exceptional. And, most importantly, the film is wildly original and very, very stylish. The only reservations I have are minor. First, while this is a very, very good film, I can't see why it is ranked #5 all-time on IMDb. This seems wildly overrated and too often more recent films seem to dominated IMDb's Top 250. Second, this film is certainly NOT for everyone, as in spots it is tremendously violent (like any Tarantino film) and should not be viewed by kids or the overly sensitive.

Because there are so many reviews for the film already, I won't bother to try to give a synopsis of the film or do an in-depth analysis.

3. Pulp Fiction,10/10,Unbelievable.,"Pulp Fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definition of pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever assembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken. The dialog is surprisingly humorous for this type of film, and I think that's what has made it so successful. Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie (although Kill Bill came close). As far as I'm concerned this is the top film of all-time and definitely deserves a watch if you haven't seen it.

3. Pulp Fiction,6/10,"Overrated without a doubt, but nevertheless well made","This movie may be the most overrated film of all time, in my opinion. There is no point. It is not particularly funny. It is not particularly thought provoking. It is not some kind of masterpiece. It is, however, well made. Has good acting with a great cast. Is a fun way to divide up the scenes and plots.

I was ready for this movie to end far before it did, because I learned about halfway through that there is just no purpose to it! No meaning! I definitely enjoyed aspects of it and there was some legitimate tension, without question. It all just felt messy. Truly my favorite part of watching pulp fiction were two scenes that I had seen from different memes 100 times before, and never knew where they came from. It was a, ""oh, hey, I recognize this image!"" That was the most joy I got out of this.

By no means is it a trainwreck, but to be considered such a timeless masterpiece of cinematic glory? Not a chance. I would like to speak to every single person who gives this a 10 and have them explain to me what exactly this film does well, because I feel pretty confident everyone just gets in line and calls it amazing because that is the 'cool' thing to do."

3. Pulp Fiction,10/10,One of the best films of the 90s,"What can I say? This film is amazing, and I would go further and say it is my favourite Quentin Tarantino film, and one of my favourites of the 90s. The cinematography and scenery are spellbinding, and the soundtrack is brilliant, one of the best soundtracks in a Tarantino film actually. The plot is every bit as compelling as that for Reservoir Dogs, while the dialogue is endlessly quotable and quite hard-boiled. The direction is superb, as are the performances. As excellent as Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and Christopher Walken are, the film's best actors are John Travolta and Samuel L.Jackson who are unforgettable. Pulp Fiction also has a wealth of characters and crossplots that is really quite astonishing. All in all, brilliant. 10/10 Bethany Cox

3. Pulp Fiction,10/10,One of the best movies of the century!,
4. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,10/10,One Step Above Masterpiece!,"It's honestly absurd how good the ""Spider-Verse"" movies are. ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is just as great, if not better than ""Into the Spider-Verse"". I really don't know how. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is fantastic! Deftly juggles deeply heartfelt character beats with crazy multiverse content, just packed with so many delightful easter eggs. Loved how Gwen's story is expanded, her scenes with Shea Whigham's Captain Stacy are truly special.

Can't wait for the third one. Every frame of this movie is gorgeous! I didn't want to blink because I didn't want to miss anything. You can watch this film over & over & finds something new to enjoy. There are some surprises in this film that I truly wasn't expecting.

""Across the Spider-Verse"" is another milestone for animation. Yes it's gorgeous & visually mind-blowing, but this sequel surpasses the first for always putting Miles and his family front and center. The movie feels like a massive celebration for Spider-Man fans everywhere, whether you love the movies, games, comics, etc. But again, all the cameos and multiversal elements come second to both Miles and Gwen's story. Is a stunning achievement. Yes, it's visually dazzling, with expansive, expressive new realms The movie's real superpower is its emotional depth and its beautiful, melancholic tone.

What more can I say...It's an actual work of art! Every frame deserves to be hung in a museum. The jokes and nods to Spidey lore are perfect. It's outstanding. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is yet another resounding win for the Lord Miller-produced universe. Hailee Steinfeld really comes into her own as Gwen Stacy. It's darker and sadder than I expected, but necessary."
4. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,10/10,Masterful IMAX Spider-Man,"The animation, flow of everything, genius character development, and action were all electrifying! This is one of the best Spider-Man adaptions deserving of the high ratings entirely. I love all the portals connecting to other dimensions and Spot is such a fun villain. Shemeik Moore, Hailee Steinfield, Jake Johnson, and Oscar Issac among everyone else was superb so much talent this movie better be nominated for best animated feature like the previous one was years back deserving of its win! For a movie that's fairly long it stayed entertaining from start to finish and keeps you wanting more, I loved it all so much.

Also since this review is doing well I have autism and would love any opportunity to be more known in the world! My real name is Alex Nolan and I crave movies a lot since I was quite young. I wish I could work on movies and spend time with famous people.

4. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,10/10,One of the best sequels to anything ever made,"If it wasn't already obvious in the first film, it's now officially clear as day that the people behind the Spider-Verse franchise (including writers/producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller, who are absolute creative godsends to the once magnificent place known as Hollywood) understand EXACTLY what they're working with.

Don't let the marketing fool you: this film has GUTS. It's easily one of the heaviest PG-rated films I've ever seen. Payoffs and character revelations that were only hinted at in the first film are carefully, deliberately unraveled and come around beautifully. It made me think about my own life and what I mean to the people I care about in ways I never expected. The fan-service is BATTY too, and yet somehow it's never too much.

I wish every movie was as good as this---but then again if the world was like that this wouldn't feel as special. So I'll just stick to being IMMENSELY grateful that it exists in this universe.

This is no ordinary sequel. It's art of the highest form."
4. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,10/10,A new Empire Strikes Back,"This film is a visual concert. The animation and character design neatly put me to tears. The opening of the film took an approach that shocked me, but it was fantastic to watch. Many of the jokes were in the trailers, but plenty caught me off guard in the cinema. Miguel even had a couple of funny moments. The presence of existing spider characters, such as snippets of the other films, did feel somewhat strange I have to admit. However, it is made up for in how incredible this film was. It was artistic, mature, adult, and profound. It leaves the viewer on a cliffhanger that shocked me. I thought I was an hour into the film, but it was the end. I implore everyone wondering if they should see this film to do so. Easily the best film I have seen in a long time and the best film to see in theaters. A true masterpiece.

4. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,7/10,My feelings about this sequel are currently glitching,"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is probably my favorite Spider-Man movie. However, my feelings about Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse are currently glitching. On one hand, the action scenes are spectacular, and the animation is, once again, amazing. On the other hand, this movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long and it feels like it. Plus, the visuals can be so kinetic that the film becomes busy & chaotic. This sequel offers some real drama, however it's not a complete story, and it ends on a cliffhanger. I think my rating will solidify when I watch Beyond the Spider-Verse and see how it all ends.

4. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,7/10,"It's good, but I still like the first one better. (7.5)","Let me just say that the first hour of this film had me hooked and I just knew this film surpass it's predecessor in terms of the story & entertainment. Around the 2 hour mark I started wondering when or if there would be a climax? Various scenes felt like they were dragging on for way too long. We really didn't need all the scenes of Peter B. Parker and his child. For me personally I felt like there was no build up or anticipation due to how long certain scenes played out. Then the film ended on a cliffhanger and then I understood, this film is a middle movie, a gateway between the first film and the next film and unfortunately it showed. They didn't have a definitive ending for this film which is fine but at some point the scenes just felt like filler. I believe it is still a movie worth seeing, however, it falls short of the first movie in terms of keeping my attention.

4. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,10/10,My movie of 2023 so far.,"It's been some time since I've walked out from a cinema feeling as satisfied by a film as this!

I enjoyed Into The Spider-verse, in my humble opinion, this went one better, my anticipation for the next installment has definitely gone up a few notches.

The best element for me, the visuals, I'd argue this was a labour of love by the team behind it, it looks sublime, the action sequences are seamless, one to the next, jaw dropping.

Pacing is terrific, visit the loo or go for a drink at your peril, you may just miss something.

I think this is a film that fans of Spider Man, any fans, new or old will enjoy, its appeal is so broad.

I'm not a die hard Spidey fan, so some of it went over my head, but I am reliably informed by my fellow cinema goers that there were plenty of Easter eggs to hunt, lots of references to all forms of Spider Man.

Shameik Moore did a first rate job, as did Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen, her character development was a key element.

I assume this will win many awards, it deserves to, that good I'm going again!!!

Nailed it!! 10/10."
4. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,6/10,This is one of the most overhyped movies I have ever watched.,"I really enjoyed Into the Spider-Verse, but the way people hyped this movie up they made it seem like it was some award winning masterpiece of cinema but in my opinion it's fails to live up to the legacy of the first one.

Visually this film is a spectacle like the first one but that only does so much when you are watching a 2hr+ film. The fact that this is a cliffhanger and it ends very abruptly makes it feel like it's both overly long and incomplete. There is so much going on in this film and so many new characters introduced and just as the plot finally starts to pick up and get good they end it on the cliffhanger. I don't understand how people are giving this movie such a high score but complaining so much about Fast X doing the same thing. This film is not complete and for that reason I felt like it wasn't as enjoyable as it could've been.

Like many other incredibly high ranked movies, I'm sure over time the score will drop but given it's so high now, I cannot imagine it leveling off below 8.0...meaning it's one of the best rated movies of all time. Well, while it might be a great crowd-pleaser, I am writing a dissenting review....and if you are like me, you might not be as bowled over as most reviewers.

To put things in perspective, I am 59 years-old and certainly NOT in the target audience....so keep this in mind. While I like an occasional superhero film, I also don't adore them...but I did think the previous Spider-Man film, ""Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse"" was one of the best of its genre. In fact, I gave it a 10...I was that impressed with its originality and story and animation. So why was I left colder by its sequel? Well, there are several reasons. First, if you are like me and not all that familiar with Spider-Man, you'll probably find much of the story confusing...unlike the previous film. Second, the artwork, while very original, made my brain hurt! It was LOUD and BRASH and really awful...at least to me. The worst part was that the backgrounds actually looked like I was watching a 3-D movie WITHOUT 3-D glasses! Uggh...it was an assault on my eyes. And, third, I hated how the film ended with no plot resolution whatsoever....none.

So does all this mean I hated the film? No. I laughed quite a few times...and mostly when it introduced other alternate universe Spider-creatures (many are women or animals...not just Spider-MEN). I also thought the basic story, once you strip away the horribly fast edits and garish artwork, was very interesting. Overall, not a bad film but I just did not particularly enjoy it nor do I particularly need to see the third and final film in the series."
4. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,7/10,"Wanted to Love it, But Just Liked it","I absolutely loved 2018's ""Into the Spider-Verse"". It not only earned its ""Best Animated Picture"" Oscar, not only was it the best Spider-Man movie, but it stands as a landmark in animation. It set the record for most animators working on a single film. That record was then broken by this sequel. With five years of anticipation, and with the talented hands of Lord and Miller behind the scenes I was super hyped for this movie. I was prepped to love this film. I had heard nothing but good things, and all its praise is well deserved. But I couldn't help but walk away just saying the film was...good.

Given the film's stellar reception, I feel compelled to explain why I only am giving this film a respectable 7. First off, this film is not a complete story. It is a ""part 1"" and ends on a ""To Be Continued..."". I don't think that's a spoiler considering the original teaser advertised it as ""Across the Spider-Verse: Part 1"". But like the great cliff hangers of the past, like ""Two Towers"", ""Empire Strikes Back"" or ""Back to the Future part 2"", the movie needs to complete some self-contained conflict. This film does not complete a conflict. There is no feeling of resolution. I feel my full review is currently being held hostage from the fact that the story is incomplete. I can't give this full marks considering the story could end like the series ""Lost"" and completely undermined the whole journey.

With that out of the way, I can tell you all the things that makes this movie great. The animation is a step up even from the previous groundbreaking entry. There are so many different animation styles that the team juggles, and it they all looked visually stunning. For some it may be over stimulation, but I thought it moved at just the right speed.

The ""fan service"", ""Easter Eggs"" or whatever you want to call them, are never overused. There are some movies that treat the Easter Eggs like they are the main course, this movie balances them well. They never overstay their welcome and always add to the story as opposed to distract from it.

The humor is spot on. There are so many jokes in this movie that had me laughing awkwardly loud. The jokes don't have the typical MCU problem of detracting from a serious moment, those are given the time to breath. But the jokes are fast paced, witty and come from a variety of sources. There are visual gags, character jokes, situational jokes and it isn't all reliant on a single person for their humor.

And the action in this movie, it is next level stuff. Every fight scene or chase scene is like the bridge fight in ""Kung Fu Panda"". The movement is fluid, the detail is superb, and everything falls in just the right place. It is poetry in motion, since they are Spider-Men doing the action, all the acrobatics and reflexes work well within the story. It is a reminder of what makes this character so much fun to write for.

There are 2 main conflicts that pop up in the story, both feeding into the same narrative theme. When the second comes into focus, that is where the movie loses some momentum. It is nice for story reasons in that our hero feels completely alone. The problem is it raises a lot of questions that might get answered in later movies, but for now are ignored. On the positive side, just when I think I have the film figured out, it throws one last hook at me, and absolutely has me hooked for the next one.

Who knows, maybe one day when the trilogy is completed, I will come back and amend my review. But as it stands right now, I can't give it anything higher than what I gave it. Don't let me down third movie, with great power, comes great responsibility."
4. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,9/10,"Across the Universe Of Fun, Excellence, and Adventure: Spider-Man Makes A Connected Web Of Wow","LIKES:

The Pace For The Most Part -Comic book movies are an art that requires balance to tell all it has to tell, and Miles' next story.. has A LOT to tell.

-It found a good pace for me to tell the story, giving you the character development, but not at a pace that was too slow and lost on itself, for the most part.

-Yet, the movie did manage to keep it slow enough that there was real development, build up, hints, and appreciation to age like fine wine.

-This dynamic was very impressive to me, keeping an engaging movie for my attention, but not skimping out on the action like some of these deeper movies try to do.

-That takes talent in the cooking pot as big as this, building on the past movie, but yet doing its own thing until the end for the setup.

The Voice Acting -Everyone rocks in this movie, and I have to agree with my friend that it is grade A on many levels with what you get in live action movies.

-Isaac is still strong as the anti-hero role that he often plays. His moodiness, his anger, his dark edge are mirrored in the character. There is hurt, anguish, and the fire that he shows so well, and I love how his voice is the main focus in his performance and not the looks.

-Hailee Steinfeld is fantastic in Gwen. It's like taking all of her characters from her movie and integrating a piece of them into this Gwen and expanding her far into a character I really liked.

-She was vulnerable and strong, a realistic character whose performance came out in spades and fully awakened the character I think they were going for.

-And Moore... well Moore is just freaking amazing as Morales. That tone, vulnerability, this maturity but still immaturity cascading and once more evolving a character from the first one being believable. A stellar performance and one that I think brought so many things together, engaging with each of the others into this dynamic role.

-It all works so well and I loved the strong talent bringing things to life.

The Storytelling -There are so many who say that comic movies seldom tell a good story or are telling the same story over and over again. And to a degree... they are right.

-Yet... for Across the Spider-Verse, that story feels fresh, engaging, and grounded to a degree that helps balance reality and super heroism into a great mashup.

-It's not so in your face super adventures that are all about action, violence, and CGI madness, but it also isn't CW bologna about exploring our feelings in colorful underwear.

-This sequel really focuses so much on building up characters, but integrating it into this main comic adventure that works to keep both involved and feel like a superhero.

-I love the heart into it, and the way they built up from the first movie, but yet made this movie its own thing, until the final moments where the known cliffhanger was going to come in.

-And to add relative components to it, engaging characters, and keeping those characters involved in the story... that is tough work.

The Comedy To A degree -I really enjoyed the diverse comedy in this movie, and how many types of jokes and styles that were in it.

-Miles is sort of a jack of all trades, sarcasm, banter, slapstick, he has a little bit of everything in it and I love it.

-Others are just rambling idiots who are throwing so many jokes and statements that some eventually hit, but you have to listen because they fluctuate in terms of volume and such.

-And other jokes are so well-timed and loaded with sarcasm that you just appreciate the laugh from the time alone.

-It has it all and in relative balance to keep things fresh and not overwhelmingly stale as they hope from one joke to the other.

The Nostalgia and Easter Eggs -Part of that comedy comes in the references loaded into this movie almost as much as the plot in this movie, and it works.

-Across the Spider-Verse, tackles many famous tropes in both Spiderman comics and movies, blending the two of them together into this natural flowing arc that utilizes it well.

-Nostalgia reigns supreme in this movie, all the comic and show references of the webbed wonder just taking my child nature and taking it for the roller coaster ride of finding everything I could.

-But the movie references as well... so much fun as well, seeing these micro moments and nods to the other universes and watching them blended into the comedy and story.

-Then to have it just in the world, it's going to make for a fun rewatch potential in the future.

The Action Scenes -A huge step up, Across the Spider-Verse took my dislike from the first film and unleashed much more of the action I knew it had.

-The opening scene paints for some great things to come, but soon the fight scenes and adventure transform into something that is fun, exciting, and family friendly.

-Chase scenes have energy, with styles that flow and show off the heart of the animation, feels of the comic book and fan art coming together into this cascade of color and energy.

-I loved the way that they evolved past punches and added more emotions and stakes that though predictable still held glimmer of exciting twists if they come.

-And the fact they can punch, kick, and slam without being bloody messes should please so many, alongside the fact that the action all goes in line with the actual plot.

The Animation/Art Style -You've seen the trailers and the first one and know how beautiful the movie is. Amidst the blurry backgrounds, the movie really has bold art direction that captures comic book spirit.

-The computer animation goes well with the natural feel of the art, and I loved the way it felt like flipping through a flip book and seeing it come to life.

-It respects both worlds so well, and like the story keeps things easy to follow and discover to appreciate everything the Spider-Verse had to offer. That was epic.

-And to keep all that in relatively stable camera work, something the first movie struggled with, shows how you can really continue to improve if you take the time and think things through.

DISLIKES:

The Comedy A Bit Too Forced -There are times where the humor is a bit forced for me, primarily in the moments where they just spout joke after joke after joke to the point where things get lost.

-These moments are few and far between for me, but there are times where a character gets annoying over funny.

Some Pacing Offsets -There are times where the movie trips up on the pace for me. A few moments where the conversations are dragged out or we get a tad touchy feeling and not enough of seeing what's going on.

-This happened about the first hour or so for me, but once that part passes most of the movie establishes the pace I talked about for much of the movie.

-At least until the need.

The Ending 20 minutes for me -The ending 20 minutes felt very dragged out as it set up the cliffhanger we knew was coming the moment it said part 1 long ago.

-The ending is very drawn out, you know the movie is over, and you know what is coming, but it uses the art to drag it out, bloating the movie for the twenty minutes that could have been in the next movie.

-Fortunately one of the final moments adds that fantastic bridge with music, shots, and feels that work, but still... we could have cut a few things out.

-And fortunately there are no end credits, which there does not need to be.

The Sound Quality With Some Characters -It might have been my theater, but some of the characters mumble and talk fast meaning... it's hard to hear them.

-Spider-Punk has some of the best lines, but they get drowned out by background noise, mumbling speakers, and sound inconsistencies.

-This leads to missing several things and taking away from the character that seems so cool, and this happens to several other characters when there is so much noise. As such, those moments are annoying to me, but again could be theater dependents.

The VERDICT: Overall, the praise is worthy to Across the Spider-Verse, and I was very happy with much of the film that they brought to life to this theater. It's a sequel that does things right, taking the first movie's foundations and bringing with it something to build up and enjoy to the full extent. That bold and beautiful art has been refined to near perfection, and does so much storytelling alone that it's almost enough to go see it just for that in theater. But the movie integrates story, morals, comedy, nostalgia, and action to a degree that really feels like some of the strongest storytelling in a superhero movie. I love the authentic feel of a superhero story, and I love the passion of balancing so much in a movie without every losing track of the story to tell. Sure there were pacing issues and some sound flops for me, but that's really minor when it comes to the movie overall and everything they did to make this movie the middle of the trilogy, but still stand on its own. You can obviously guess I'm recommending this for the theater, and yes families can see it as there aren't too much dark moments. And my scores for those who need it are:

Animation/Action/Adventure: 9.0-9.5 Movie Overall: 8.5."
4. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,5/10,Spastic mess of a film.,"It's obvious by the 10 star reviews that we live in a generation where if you drag a TikTok video out for two and a half hours the mindless will be entertained.

Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of good in this film, hence why I gave it a solid 5.

But it's an absolute mess. Exploring it's visuals rather than it's characters it switches art every 5 seconds it seems. It never lingers, never breathes, never lets you absorb it.

It can't decide if it wants to be teen angst, family drama, superhero, commentary. It's simply all over the place forgetting it's villain several times during the running.

Oh and congrats for absolutely destroying the Spider-Man 2099 character.

4. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,10/10,the greatest spider-man film ever.,"I am absolutely lost for words. How the hell did they top the first one??? This is easily, without a shadow of a doubt, the film of the year. It perfectly balances humour and emotional beats on a razor thin blade. It's richly layered, complex and the attention to detail is absolutely incredible. The story is phenomenal, the characters are believable and have excellent levels of depth, the soundtrack is fantastic. My expectations were completely exceeded, I spent the entire 2h 30m runtime in awe. But one thing above all deserves very special praise :

THE ARTWORK.

This films aesthetic is jaw-dropping, I found myself plunged (for the second time now) straight into the pages of a comic book from my youth. The use of colour is remarkable, the animation is smoother than silk, the textures, the backgrounds, the lighting, the style itself - everything blends together perfectly to create one of the most visually stunning things ever committed to the screen. Almost any shot could be a painting, with inextricable layers upon layers of marvellous detail, hand-crafted by some extremely talented individuals. This is cinema.

If this doesn't win the Oscar for best animated feature I'm rioting, and you'd better join me. GO AND SEE THIS FILM RIGHT NOW."
4. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,6/10,So Overhyped That I Felt Disappointed,"I was a huge fan of the first movie, excited for the sequel and pretty hopeful after I saw massive amount of RAVE reviews online claiming it to be better than the original. Well, that couldn't be further from the truth. The runtime was way too long and I FELT it from the beginning of the movie! (during Gwen's 20 minute opening.) By the time the film picked up its pace and stakes (the last 30 minutes) I was already mentally checking out, watching the time and waiting for it to end. And yes, basically nothing is resolved by the end of it, if you're wondering. Multiple people in my theater were groaning as the credits began rolling, due to the cliffhanger. Scenes stretched on far too long, had repetitive dialogue and just set up the final movie. I truly don't see the hype about this one. I think the wrap up next year will be good, I have seen films do a better job in a trilogy of making the second movie mean something. I feel harsh saying this, as the animation, soundtrack and characters are awesome! I just feel like people are acting like this is the best animated movie to be released, but it's just not. It doesn't live up to the greatness of it's predecessor. Hopefully the finale next year will make it all worth it!"
4. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,6/10,"Decent, nowhere as good as the first","Takes itself way too seriously, and fails to tell a compelling story.

The writers apparently tried to re-use the formula for the first Spider-Verse movie, at the expense of character growth.

This movie has a cliff-hanger ending, meaning that it's really just half of a movie. It hurts the pacing.

The action is very predictable, but at the same time, the story is unnecessarily complicated. There's never any fear that any of the main characters are in danger.

Overall, it's missing the wholesome, lighthearted moments which were so endearing in the first movie. This is a good movie to skip in the theaters and catch on streaming/DVD.

4. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,6/10,Many theater goers walked out before ending,"I generally liked the animation but it constantly reminded me of trying to watch a 3D movie without the 3D glasses. The petty drama is endless and becomes old fast. There are loads of action scenes that immediately devolve into slow soap opera drama. My wife and I kept nodding off during these whine-a-thones which seemed very contrived. I did like all of the iterations of spider flavors in the Spiderverse which were endlessly creative and entertaining. The music always suggests exciting action scenes but this becomes a little exhausting after the 4th or 5th wind up. Long winded exposition seems necessary to spoon feed a very lengthy and convoluted plot. When I booked I noticed the theater was sold out but we left before the end and noticed that only 10 members of the audience still remained having left before us. Spot was a good albeit comedic villain. I would suggest going just for the animation and humor even with the 140min run time.

4. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,10/10,Perfect,"The 5 years was worth the wait. Amazing animation, beautiful characters with rich backstories, the fights are amazing, Gwen's story is amazing, EVERYTHING IS AMAZING! This entire movie is gorgeous and keeps you hooked and almost forces you to continue watching, that's how amazing it is. The hype around this movie was 100% deserved and made sense, seeing as how this movie may be the greatest film I have ever seen.

This isn't your run of the mill kids move, action movie, animated movie. It's a masterpiece that all ages can enjoy. An amazing sequel that sets extremely high hopes for the third movie.

4. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,5/10,Disappointing,"I loved into the spiderverse, it had great animation, great characters, great plot development and great music. There is simply no way across the spiderverse is better. By the end of this it felt like they were dragging it out and I had lost interest quite some time previously. The animation is good but sometimes less is more, and there was less differentiation between the styles, I don't think bill sienkiewicz was involved in this one. I remember my emotions building in the first one, peaking when what's up danger kicked in in the soundtrack, but this got into some schlocky emotional teen drama territory that made me yawn. I also felt it was a bit cynical to split it in two, I'm sure the full story could have been told in one movie which would have upped the quality of the animation too. Then there was the sense of universal danger overload that this and other stories revert to to ramp up the drama; whether a universe or every parallel universe and it's uncle is at stake, who cares, trying to make it bigger than before doesn't increase drama, that comes from character and plot development, yeah, like it did in the first one. It needed more jokes too, nowhere near as funny as the last time."
4. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,2/10,I Was Bored To Death!,"Spider-Man - Across the Spider verse

I am at a loss to understand the high scores on this movie, it was tedious in the extreme, we had no proper story, all that remained was emotions, feelings and a whole array of woke tropes. The one thing that is central to the Spider-man comics is a good strong story and nearly every film reflects this need, here it was missing.

The graphics were very weird and at times just looked half finished, it was very much style over substance, Disney/Pixar would have realised this so we, the viewer, remain focused on the story and not the artwork. Animation must not be the star of the show, it is merely a vehicle in telling a story, even in Tron, animation at its most extreme, served to tell the story.

With had scene after scene of breathless freneticism, I was quite frankly bored, this amounts to ""meat and no bones"", you just cannot sustain a movie on action alone, you observe in Rocky or Mission Impossible how all the action sequences are balanced with other elements.

I really can't see why this movie was made and who was the target audience, I am a life long fan of Spider-Man, and this left me cold as it had just nothing for the fans, and it totally lacked any humour which is key.

I'm giving this 2 outta 10 to my mind it was a disaster."
4. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,7/10,Half of a movie,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is the first of a two part movie. These studios should be legally required to put ""part 1"" in the title. Fast X did the same thing and I felt unsatisfied when the movie abruptly ends with everything completely unresolved.

Now Across the Spider-Verse endlessly better, but I still had that unsatisfied feeling when I realized I was watching the first half of a really long movie. So much is set up in the first act, including a cool villain, and is left completely unresolved.

Think about your favorite movies. Now imagine that when you saw them for the first time, someone cut it off halfway through and made you wait a year for the rest. A movie needs to be able to stand on its own.

Aside from that, I pretty much love this movie. I don't think it's as good as the original, but that's a high bar. The animation is incredible, especially during a long intro scene in a different universe. There are so many different styles and techniques. The characters are awesome, as are the ideas in this story.

My only real issue is that the story felt a little messy and all over the place. But that made way more sense when I realized it was half of a movie. That's why we're still getting setup and introducing conflicts late in the movie. We'll have to wait and see how the second part pulls it all together. I also found the sound a little low during the action scenes and sometimes had trouble hearing the dialogue, even in Dolby Atmos.

I already can't wait to see the next one. And if it does everything right, I can see myself raising the score for this one. I had a great time with Across the Spider-Verse. I also feel a bit unsatisfied.

EDIT: On second viewing, I feel the same. It's awesome, but it's not complete. Instead of exciting escalation to a beastly climax, in the last half hour we get setup.

4. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,7/10,Audible groan from the cinema when it finished,"Adjusted rating - 8.5/10: a genuine spectacle, you could take thousands of shots from this movie and turn them into posters, it's beautiful to look at. I'd definitely suggest seeing this at the cinema because the use of colours and the work which has gone into the animations is undoubtedly the highlight, I actually can't think of a more visually creative movie I've seen. Great soundtrack too, and quite funny. One of my criticisms is it's got that ""Deadpool"" kind of style where literally everything is tongue in cheek, it needed more genuinely serious scenes just to break it up. Like there are these big arguments and then a joke is thrown in half way through, who does that? Also it's got quite bad dialogue but it's a family superhero movie so I went in expecting that, only a minor point really.

Real rating - 7/10: it's half a movie man!! It's a part 1, and I feel a bit cheated that I went in not knowing that. There was commotion in the cinema when it ended, a lot of people were annoyed. I just don't get this trend in cinema, for me a great movie needs to be able to stand on its own. 2h30 is plenty of time to tell a compelling story without ending on a cliffhanger. Think the plot would've been better suited to a series format - it's already kind of like a high budget Arcane in feel - but obviously that wouldn't work with the first movie and it wouldn't make as much money. To make it a great movie they should've dissolved one of the sub plots and actually finished it."
4. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,7/10,All over the place,"Across the Spider-Verse is a good film, better than the first one for sure but not something that should have 8.9 rating. I'm mixed about the animation, some things look really great but the other half is nauseating. I really didn't like the phasing, the movie is more than 2 hours long and it feels like the chase scene in the multiverse takes 1/3 of the film. The Spot is a fun villain but still don't get how he suddenly goes from wanting to rob an ATM machine to wanting to destroy the entire world, don't like how he just disappeared for the rest of the film. Miguel was fun even though his backstory was also really generic. Across the Spider-Verse is a good movie, but it relies on flashy animation and fanservice to cover up it's flaws. For example, am I the only one not ok with classic Peter Parker bringing his daughter to extremely dangerous places? Or with Spider-Woman getting slammed to a train while being pregnant? Also, too many Spider-Mans are just a parody of themselves. Don't get me started with awful modern humor. Overall, the sequel is better than the first film, but even more overrated. Flawed plot, great animation, ok soundtrack, fun action, too much fanservice."
5. The Shawshank Redemption,10/10,Some birds aren't meant to be caged.,
5. The Shawshank Redemption,10/10,An incredible movie. One that lives with you.,"It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't said before? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget.

The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity.

I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it. If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it's amazing. 10/10.

5. The Shawshank Redemption,10/10,Don't Rent Shawshank.,"I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.

Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today.

Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar.

How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Citizen Kane."" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time.

Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame.

But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title."
5. The Shawshank Redemption,10/10,This is How Movies Should Be Made,"This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.

Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"".

The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.

Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want."

5. The Shawshank Redemption,10/10,A classic piece of unforgettable film-making.,
5. The Shawshank Redemption,10/10,The Shawshank Redemption,"One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.

He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years.

5. The Shawshank Redemption,10/10,Stephen King's best adapted movie,"Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.

This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.

King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully.

What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.

I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come."
5. The Shawshank Redemption,10/10,"Enthralling, fantastic, intriguing, truly remarkable!",
5. The Shawshank Redemption,10/10,Eternal Hope,"I've lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, but it is more than 20. It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.

I have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movie.

Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.

Something that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action, no special effects and no gimmicks. 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking. Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the end.

For me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout. The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins. The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it, no matter how many times I have seen it.

Brilliant, brilliant movie and a must see for everyone."
5. The Shawshank Redemption,10/10,IMDb and the Greatest Film of All Time,"Two imprisoned men (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.

Is this the greatest film of all time? IMDb would have you believe so. Despite being a box office flop (that barely recouped its budget), the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray.

And it deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year. Now twenty years old, the film has not aged a day, and instead seems to be getting better. This is Tim Robbins' best role, and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan Freeman.

5. The Shawshank Redemption,10/10,"Simply known as ""The Movie""","Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as ""The Movie"". When I say ""The Movie"", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about. In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those ""Budget Theaters"" over the summer of 1995. None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good. So, not having any real expectations, we saw it. When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said ""That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!"" There's really no other way I can put it in words. Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... ""HOPE"". This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time. I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history! How it all just ""comes together"" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a ""must buy"" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see. I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films. However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, ""That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!"" There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my ""favorite of all time"", but they've all fallen far short of ""The Shawshank Redemption"". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately. You're guaranteed to find it in the ""employee picks"" section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them. If you have seen this movie, go see it again. If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one. In fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an emergency. :o) So, you want a 1-10 rating??? I give it a 13!!!!!!"
5. The Shawshank Redemption,10/10,Simply amazing. The best film of the 90's.,
5. The Shawshank Redemption,9/10,"""I Had To Go To Prison To Learn To Be A Crook""",
5. The Shawshank Redemption,10/10,Shawshank Redeems Hollywood,"Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.

The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.

By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.

While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.

With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.

With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom. These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date. Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience. Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.

This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget."
5. The Shawshank Redemption,10/10,never give up hope,"""The Shawshank Redemption"" should have won Best Picture for 1994. A story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) getting falsely convicted of murder and sent to the hellish Shawshank prison, the movie is beyond amazing. In prison, Andy meets Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who was imprisoned many years earlier. Red gets Andy a poster of Rita Hayworth. Over the next twenty years, Andy experiences all the horrors that one would expect in jail: beatings by the guards, rapes by other inmates, and so on. But he never gives up hope.

This movie, like ""Carrie"", ""The Shining"", ""Dolores Claiborne"", ""The Green Mile"" and ""Hearts in Atlantis"", just goes to show what a great author Stephen King is. When we think of horror, we think of spooky horror, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a different kind: personal horror. Pure genius. I can only hope that in the coming years, this movie is recognized as what it is: a masterpiece. I can't believe that it won no Oscars!

5. The Shawshank Redemption,10/10,Powerful Masterpiece,
5. The Shawshank Redemption,10/10,Hope can set you free and so can this remarkable film,"One of my favorite movies ever,The Shawshank Redemption is a modern day classic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and find solace over the years in which this movie takes place.Based on a Stephen King novel,this movie makes us feel different watching this film than most others as this is an incredibly realistic film.Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne who is convicted of murder and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding who is a fellow inmate and close friend of Dufresne and Bob Gunton as Warden Samuel Norton who is the Warden of Shawshank State Prison and is a character who has mixed feelings and emotions towards everyone around him and a character who is sometimes easy to like and at other times easy to despise.This film is easily considered one of the greatest films of all time and I definitely agree with this fact.It was nominated for seven Academy Awards including (Best Picture, Best Actor  Morgan Freeman, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Score, and Best Sound) but didn't win any due to tough competition from the film Forrest Gump.I personally think that Tim Robbins should have been nominated for the Best Actor award as he really gave the performance of his career.Bravo to this brilliant modern day classic!"
6. Interstellar,10/10,Out of this world,"A lot has been said and written about Interstellar. You can obviously take apart any movie that is out there. You'll either love this one or you won't. I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It's not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it's the story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it's heading (no pun intended), but it doesn't change the fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time.

Going out and saying this will be considered a classic, might not be too far stretched, but you still can never predict those things. The deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really good, but I can understand if some people have issues with the ending. But the movie had to end in one way or another. It's the best possible way this could go, even if it's not in our grasps just yet ..."
6. Interstellar,10/10,A visual and auditory marvel,"Interstellar is a movie like no other. Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.

Not everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth—crops and humans.

Farming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, ""we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it."" For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score. The sound literally took my breath away. Forgive me for the next paragraph. I will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movie's sound. Skip it if you please. You have your warning.

The music fueled every important scene. In every meaningful moment Zimmer's harmonies captivated watchers' attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. The music elucidated those emotional scenes, particularly ones featuring Cooper and his daughter, in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. I sat frozen, jaw agape, with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. The sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body, flowing to my appendages, supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. The music was truly the life force of movie.

Yes, we all witnessed a visual triumph, a daring creative wonder the likes of which we haven't encountered since Inception. Yes, nearly every actor's performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything.

I walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special. Interstellar inspires, it awes, and above all it entertains. I cannot ask for more than that."
6. Interstellar,10/10,Masterpiece,"A science-fiction masterpiece. Nolan executes a marvelous direction that slowly but efficiently puts in place a dark world creating a necessity to save humanity. Add to that great performances from Nolan and Hathaway plus a great score from Hans Zimmer. The result is on the best science-fiction movies of all time.

6. Interstellar,10/10,Possibly the best movie of all time,"I think just about everything has been said about this film now. But, I can still tell you what this masterpiece is to me. To me, this movie is possibly the most relevant movie ever, because it questions our own humanity relative to the Universe. Whether that's our ability to love, think, or persevere and walk into the unknown. We are explorers, and curious at heart. This untameable curiosity is not our end, but our beginning. It is what advanced this civilization and it will continue to do so. So never, never let anybody tell you that we shouldn't look towards the stars and wonder, because that's what makes us human. Without this stargazing we are merely animals, accepting our fate in the dust...

Well, I watched this movie all the way through with no bathroom breaks. My interest was grabbed from the start and held all the way through. Being old enough, and lucky enough to have watched the premiere of 2001 A Space Odyssey - and viewed it several times since - of course I made comparisons, and there were a few, but this movie tells an excellent stand alone story that is both riveting and believable. I'm not going to give away any secrets but anyone who watches the last five minutes or so without a lump in their throat and a tear in their eye, well you're a critic, you're not enjoying the movie because you're too busy looking for bloopers and faults. Were there bloopers and faults? The darn movie was so riveting if there were any I didn't notice them!

6. Interstellar,9/10,Absolutely Brilliant,"A team of explorers travel through a wormhole in an attempt to ensure humanity's survival.

Going into this I had mixed feelings because some have praised it, others have panned it, and some say it is good with reservations. There were allegedly issues with he sound in theaters, and any number of other issues. Then, when we get to the Oscars, the film gets nominations in the technical fields but not in the top honors.

This was wrong. Maybe this is not the best role from Matthew McConaughey or Anne Hathaway. Though, the fact that a ""Hathaway hater"" like myself enjoyed it should say something. And I think Jessica Chastain should have received a Best Supporting nomination. She easily outshines Laura Dern in ""Wild"".

6. Interstellar,10/10,A Sci-Fi Masterpiece,
6. Interstellar,10/10,Greatest movie of all time,
6. Interstellar,9/10,"An Emotional, Beautiful Journey into the Unknown","(This is both a review of the film, and an assertion of Christopher Nolan's filmmaking style)

There have been many reviewers and critics alike that have high praise for the film (the visual effects, the acting, the music), but say how it's not Christopher Nolan's best directed film. This is where i personally would have to disagree. Before i get into it, though, i'll talk about Interstellar a bit.

Interstellar is truly a sci-fi epic like no other. To compare said film to '2001: A Space Odyssey' isn't just a disservice, but unnecessary. The films are almost nothing alike, simply sharing small plot elements. Also, Stanley Kubrick's vision of Arthur C. Clarke's sci-fi epic wasn't to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story, but to make art, and art is was, and is. With Interstellar, Mr. Nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of Nolan's films). But it's so much more than that too. There are no words to express the epic journey Nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, it's tear-jerking and emotional throughout. The acting is top-notch, especially McConaughey, who gives (I would say) his most emotional performance yet. But the actor who stole the show in a few scenes (one in particular, when they're on an alien planet) was David Gyasi as Romilly, one of the astronauts aboard the Endurance, their spacecraft. The musical score from Hans Zimmer is, without a doubt, his best and most influential work to date, helping drive the film's bold and breath-taking vision (the church organ helped significantly). The visual effects are easily the best to date as well, and of the year. To see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way, with pages theoretical equations provided by Kip Thorne (theoretical physicist, of whom's work inspired the film's genesis); what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole, and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. But even everything else, from the alien planets to the Endurance, the visuals always look real. Then, there's the writing. I would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue i've ever heard in a sci-fi movie, and the script continually pours or oozes emotion, keeping the audience tethered to the film.

Now, about Mr. Nolan. Don't just look at Nolan, but look at his films. Some say Inception would be his masterpiece, while others would say it's The Dark Knight, or Memento. But honestly, every single film Christopher Nolan has directed is a masterpiece not of its genre, but of Nolan. Following is his quiet masterpiece, not the film that put Mr. Nolan on the map as a phenomenal director, but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed to Nolan, after seeing Memento, what could be called his breakout masterpiece. Then, right after, he directed the remake of the Norwegian thriller, Insomnia. This, too, could be considered a masterpiece, even if a remake. Then, we were given his take on the Batman universe, starting with Batman Begins, the origin masterpiece. Then, there's The Prestige, adapted from the novel of the same name, which can be called his dark masterpiece. The Dark Knight, his bold masterpiece; Inception, his complex masterpiece, and The Dark Knight Rises, his flawed masterpiece. Now, we have Interstellar, his emotional or personal masterpiece.

This is just my looking at Nolan and his films, but whatever your thoughts are, you can't deny Interstellar is one hell of a journey. He certainly is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and of all time. I can't wait to see what he does next, but i'm not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as Interstellar."
6. Interstellar,10/10,Fascinating Film,"The earth is plagued with droughts, famines and other apocalyptic disasters. Mankind must find a way to leave planet earth once and for all. An earth-like planet has been discovered in another solar system.

The Aging of Murph vs her father Cooper the answer is relativity playing a factor in aging - how fast time runs depend on the relative position of the observer and the subject.

6. Interstellar,10/10,A visual masterpiece.,"The fate of humanity rests in the hands of a small number of NASA pilots, who travel through a work hole in search of a new home.

I've only watched it for the second time, the first being when it first arrived on the big screen. My opinion hasn't altered since the viewing, it's an epic masterpiece, the story holds up remarkably well, but the acting and visuals all contribute to make this film something very special.

The story is remarkably good, it's cohesive, well balanced, it makes sense.

Matthew McConaughey's best film role still for me, he's awesome as the lead character, superbly supported by both Anne Hathaway and Michael Caine, it really is a well made epic.

The visuals, the special effects are all tremendous, and have held up as the years have gone past, it remains one of the most incredibly beautiful visual films of all time.

Epic 10/10."
6. Interstellar,10/10,Interstellar : An open-hearted & mastered Human Odyssey,"The film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions: men overexploited land resources, which is why the only goal they have left is to survive. This life is not enough for Cooper, brilliantly played by McConaughey who gave body and soul to this character. But all of this wouldn't hold without the total control of Christopher Nolan, based on the languishing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, the luminous and impenetrable photography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, and the sincerity of Nolan's directing. He manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time, always in harmony with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years. Thus we are transported into the same cockpit that Cooper, we feel the same remorse that he can already feel, we feel the same gravity, and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will. All of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice, which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film: to directly jump from when Cooper leaves in his truck, leaving his family behind him, to Endurance taking off. This simple editing decision allows Nolan to give an original movement to his film, and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film.

You don't necessarily have to understand it immediately : The film will raise questions in you, such as : what is it to be a human being, is there some physical limitations to our humanity, how far could we be willing to go to determine knowledge, is there other dimensions that we can not access to, and above all: what is the nature of this intact and immutable bond that unites us to others wherever we are in the universe ? Is this bond only intelligible, or is it also tangible ? All these questions resonate in harmony in Nolan's Interstellar.

Interstellar is itself a crescendo, increasing sensitivity and creativity. I use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, which is one of the most beautiful music ever scored for a sci-fi movie. We are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement, a total symbiosis, a bit like the music of Gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality. Zimmer's crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene, whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments; it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations, and manages to extend them, sometimes almost to choking, before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spell-bounded.

I have seen all the talent of the director that I knew he was outside the norm, but whom I did not know his capacity to reinvent itself. Because this is it: Interstellar is not an action movie, not really a blockbuster, and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people. It's much more than that. This is much more than just a sci-fi movie. It is unlike any of his previous films. Some hoped to see Interstellar as Christopher Nolan's best film, and they were disappointed that this was not the case. And indeed, THIS IS NOT THE BEST FILM of Christopher Nolan. Because in a way, IT IS HIS FIRST FILM. I'm not saying that Interstellar is not as good as his other films, it goes beyond all of them. But to me Interstellar is the first film of a new stage in Nolan's filmography ; it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead. Interstellar is the proof that Nolan has finally managed, despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of The Dark Knight, to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work, original, humble, sincere and deeply, meticulously, measured.

Now, in this third act of the film, it all comes to life with unparalleled strength. Nolan poses and answers questions that raise others. But he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love, that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them. But Nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy. From my point of view, only Solaris by Steven Soderbergh (2002), unfortunately neglected by the audience, was able to accomplish that. Interstellar is based on a premise which is the following : from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time, we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species, as we always leave a part of ourselves ""behind"" us. In other words, I could say that this is a human story, and even if we go as far as we want to, if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of, we will only get closer to them. Because the separation, and thus the distance and time, can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other. Because it is going to the end of the world, when we reach the end of ourselves, that we reach the singularity of the ""black hole beyond the horizon"" * : it is our humanity. No, I wasn't been able to find any bad flaws in the film. Not one, and I'm still looking. After all, Interstellar is like gravity, ""all it takes is a little push ! ""

*you'll have to see the movie to figure that one out.

6. Interstellar,10/10,An amazing Drama with Sci-Fi elements.,"The key of this movie may feel like you're watching only a Science-Fiction movie. Most of the times Sci-Fi movies are not great at telling an effective, emotional drama stories. You can't find this type of movie easily, unless you are watching a Sci-Fi movie directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Jonathan Nolan.

Mixing those two genres is unique and dangerous. All the Nolan's projects are a bit dangerous and special.

Not only the storyline is so great but also nearly all other technical details are great!

Brilliant scores that composed by Hans Zimmer.

The film editing is just beyond perfect. One of the best film editings of all time.

The Cinematography by Wally Pfister is quite realistic and charming.

The VFX are just stunning. Even the scientist are amazed by how great it is.

Some of the people thinks this movie is based on wrong theories, so that makes it a bad movie. As you may know, all the movies are based on wrong things. You are watching a Sci-Fi movie. In being realistic, Sci-Fi movies are just one step ahead of Fantasy. Why would you look for reality in this movies? It's not a crime movie. If people would demand realistic movies, there would be a bigger Documentary sector.

The main reason why people think like that is this movie is not only based on wrong theories. It's mixed. Some of the theories are proven, some of them has potential to be true, some of them are not likely true.

But you can't make a movie that reflects so effective storyline with only the truth. Even ""Based on A True Story"" movies are so changed to make it more effective. You can't name any Sci-Fi movie that based on all true theories. Other Sci-Fi movies are not explaining the questions at all. And somehow when this movie tries to explain, this movie becames faulty. So better not trying to explain what's going on? In this movie there is no major flaw that you can't ignore. The main story is just so effective and perfect."
6. Interstellar,10/10,time travel= relativity =space equilibrium= Nolan's grand space masterpiece,
6. Interstellar,8/10,Maybe the most spectacular movie of 2014 and one of the best,
6. Interstellar,10/10,Best movie I have seen in my life,"This movie was the best written, acted, visual effected, etc. movie. This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn't get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not. I give this movie a rating of 97 out of 100.

6. Interstellar,9/10,Interstellar is quite an intriguing space movie requiring some attention to the narrative,"Just watched this on IMAX with my movie theatre-working friend who had seen this before. It has Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway going to space and seeking possible livable planets for places to move the earth people when that planet becomes uninhabitable. Christopher Nolan directs quite a long but mostly intriguing tale of how long this journey lasts and the effect on McConaughey's offspring when they grow up without having him around during those times. I have to admit that part of me was ready to sleep during some scenes but something exciting does always come up and it gets a little better as the narrative keeps on going. So on that note, Interstellar is very much worth seeing if you're patient enough to watch quite a long movie requiring you to think.

6. Interstellar,10/10,Going brilliantly (but very LOUDLY) into the dark,"Wowser! This Christopher Nolan film was presaged with such marketing hype that I went in with pretty low and cynical expectations. But I was frankly blown away with it.

Just about everyone raves about Christopher Nolan's work, and you look back at his Filmography and it makes for a pretty impressive resume: from Memento via the (rather over-hyped imho) Dark Knight Batman series-reboot through to Inception, one of my favourite films of all time. For me, Interstellar is right up there with Inception for thought-provoking, visually spectacular and truly epic cinema.

We start in familiar 'Day after Tomorrow"" territory, with mankind having in some way – not entirely explained – messed up the planet. As I understood it (and the film probably does require multiple watches with – see comments below – subtitles=on) the rather clever premise is that the world's food supplies are being progressively destroyed by a vindictive 'blight'. This delivers the double whammy of destroying mankind's provisions but also, by massive reproduction of the organism, progressively depleting the Earth's oxygen. For some reason – again, which I didn't get on first viewing – this is accompanied by massive dust storms. It is a morbid bet as to what is going to get the mid-West population first: starvation, lung disease or suffocation. Matthew McConnaughey plays the widowed Cooper, an ex-NASA drop out turned farmer given the opportunity by mission-leader Professor Brand (an excellent Michael Caine) to pilot a NASA mission. The goal is to punch through a mysterious wormhole in space where they suspect, through previous work, that a new home for mankind could be found.

The first part of the film is set on and around Cooper's farm, setting in place one of the emotional wrenches at the heart of the film: that Cooper in volunteering for the mission and having to leave behind his elderly father (John Lithgow, again superb) and young children Murph (aged 10) and Tom (aged 15) whilst recognising that danger for him comes not just from the inherent risks involved but from the theory of relativity that could change everything, time-wise, for when he returns.

Cooper is supported on the mission by a team of scientists including Brand's daughter played by a love-struck Anne Hathaway, who again shows she can act.

To say any more would spoil what is a voyage of visual and mental discovery. (However, I would add that it is good to see that the character that plays my namesake Dr Mann (in a surprise cameo) is equally good looking! LOL).

In terms of plus points, where do I start? The visuals are utterly stunning. Whilst reminiscent in places of Kubrick's ""stargate"" from 2001, the similarity is only passing. The film adds a majesty and scale to space that surpasses wonder. Elsewhere there are some interesting visual effects: this might have just been me of course, but after the dramatic launch there was something about the camera moves during the first scenes of weightlessness that made me feel genuinely nauseous.

Equally stunning is Hans Zimmer's score which is epic and (in places) very VERY loud. The film certainly doesn't ""go quietly into the night""! When matching the noise of the score/choir to the sound effects in the launch sequence the combination is ear-bleedingly effective. This must be a strong contender for the soundtrack Oscar for 2014. One quibble, again 2001 related, is that Zimmer uses the last chord of Also Sprach Zarathustra in the score sufficiently often that one hopes Richard Strauss's estate receives some royalties! The acting is top notch: I've already mentioned Caine and Lithgow, but McConnaughey, Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are all great. A particular shout-out should go to Mackenzie Foy as the young Murph, who is magnetically charismatic and just brilliant in the role.

Above all, Nolan's direction is exquisite. The film has a slow build on earth (which adds to the lengthy running time) but defines the characters and primes the plot perfectly. And some of the editing cuts – again, Cooper's farm departure/launch sequence overlay is a great example – are superb in building the mood and the tension.

I've decided that I am an extremely tough reviewer and for me a 10 star film is a rarity indeed. Where I could have knocked off a star was in some of the dialogue on the soundtrack, which was pretty inaudible in places: McConnaughey in particular with his general mumbling and strong southern accent is indecipherable in places. I look forward to the DVD subtitles. And one of the character's dying words – delivering a key plot point in the film – was completely lost to me (but thankfully later restated). Whilst the expansive plot is highly ambitious, the end of the film, playing fast and loose with physics I fear, requires a gravity-defying suspension of belief (although I guess the same could equally be said of 2001: A Space Odyssey).

However, the film has stayed so firmly lodged in my mind for 24 hours I will make a rare exception to my rating 'rule'. Overall, this is a top-notch Sci-Fi film. And a final word: PEOPLE THIS IS A MUST SEE ON THE BIG SCREEN! (If you enjoyed this review, please see my archive of previous reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and sign up for future notifications.

6. Interstellar,10/10,Glad i didn't watch the trailer,"Interstellar - Review

Certain things in life are precious. Very precious. And so was the Film for me.

Why you might ask?

Well seldom do i get the chance where i find myself sitting in a cinema anxious and intrigued by what might come. In a time where trailers are omnipresent and going to the movies without having seen one seems unreasonable, outright stupid to some i had the magical chance to find myself in front of the IMAX on a cold November night with 2 tickets to Interstellar. My only knowledge was that Nolan directed it and McConaughey stars in it.

The images were brilliant the acting was top notch and everything was blended together by Hans Zimmer and his Music. 169 minutes flew by me with my eyes fixed on the screen and my heart racing. And there it was.. The ending. I couldn't believe it . I was reliving, rethinking the movie while the credit scenes rolled enjoying the moment, the smell of popcorn, my comfortable seat and what do i see next to me? Ninety percent of the people in the cinema rushing outside after the first second of the credit scenes.

..

.

Well apparently people enjoy movies different than i do. Maybe i should start watching trailers again :)."
7. The Godfather,10/10,"An offer so good, I couldn't refuse","It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.

This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.

But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.

The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.

Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.

This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.

Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement."
7. The Godfather,10/10,One of the best of all time.,"A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.

Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.

Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.

Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.

If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.

This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest, 10/10."
7. The Godfather,10/10,"For Me, This Is The Definitive Film","This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.

7. The Godfather,10/10,An Iconic Film,
7. The Godfather,10/10,"Another kind of ""family movie""",
7. The Godfather,10/10,I'm finding it hard to describe how amazing this movie was,"There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.

True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.

The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.

Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.

The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.

In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox"
7. The Godfather,10/10,"#2 on IMDb's Top 100, a multi-Oscar-winner and over 1500 reviews...what more can I say about the movie?!","Up until today, I haven't bothered to review ""The Godfather"". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.

My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience."
7. The Godfather,10/10,"Initially, I wasn't a fan... but then I realised",
7. The Godfather,10/10,"""The Godfather"" is pretty much flawless, and one of the greatest films ever made",
7. The Godfather,10/10,Everything you've ever heard is true...,"THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.

Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.

Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.

Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all."
7. The Godfather,10/10,perfect,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.

I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film.

7. The Godfather,10/10,A Masterpiece,"This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.

Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.

John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.

The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.

Do not miss this film!"
7. The Godfather,10/10,Amazing movie,"The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.

The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get."
7. The Godfather,10/10,The Don And His Sons,"My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation.

All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.

Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.

The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.

Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.

In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.

Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.

The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an ""offer he can't refuse"", or ""Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes"" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.

The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.

In fact it's all beautifully played."
7. The Godfather,10/10,The Godfather,"Engrossing motion picture that features some of the finest editing, cinematography and performances ever. There is a wonderful theme of family that runs through this film and its later sequels. No one is truly judged. Love is unconditional. God is the one who truly judges. Easily, the word masterpiece describes this film, but that's been said by so many...Who am I to argue? Masterpiece is right on the money.

7. The Godfather,10/10,Simply the best,"This film is pretty much the perfection of the craft. Every single aspect of The Godfather is outstanding. There are so many iconic lines and moments throughout the movie that have been replicated and entrenched in culture over the years. There really isn't too much else to say. This is truly the peak of filmmaking.

7. The Godfather,10/10,The world inside the underworld!,"The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.

A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.

I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.

I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.

Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy"
8. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,10/10,"First, And Still The Best Of LOTR","Here is one film that lived up to its hype, and by the time I saw it after it had arrived at the video stores, I had heard and read a ton of things about it, and seen all the awards it had received, and expected a lot. To my surprise, it did not disappoint.

Now, several years later after having watched all three of these ""Rings"" films twice each, I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good, to be sure, but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies' long journey, but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire, before the long adventure starts. If you watch all three of these films consecutively the action wears you down by midway through the final episode and it almost becomes just too much That never gets a chance to happen with the ""Fellowship"" film.

Anyway, ""Fellowship,"" stunned me for the visuals alone. I can't recall any film that has so many jaw-dropping scenes, one after the other, for three straight hours. Some are beyond description, and I don't care if they are computer- generated. So what? The fact is they are awesome to view, both in beauty and in staggering action scenes that feature incredible-looking monsters and other mythical characters.

The story covers all kinds of terrain, too, from the lush Shire of the Hobbits, to the harsh neighboring landscapes. Each couple of minutes, as in the two movies that followed, scenes radically change from calmness to action, adventure to romance, sweet lovable characters to hideous monsters, on and on and on. It's an incredible movie experience."
8. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,10/10,"The Fellowship of the Ring: Not just a Movie, but the Door to another Dimension","The first part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Fellowship of the Rings opened the door to a whole new world for me. I'd never read any of Tolkien's books when I saw the film for the first time at the theatre and, now that I've read them, in retrospect I think being a neophyte to the mythology made my LOTR movie experience all the more miraculous.

I loved The Two Towers and Return of the King almost as much as FOTR, but not quite, because seeing Fellowship for the first time was like taking a journey to a fabulous new place and meeting incredible new friends that you don't want to leave. I've never felt anything quite like what this epic evoked in me. It was akin to being a child again, with that tireless sense of wonder and enjoyment of each and every moment, maybe because as a child you are discovering your surroundings, and whatever age you are, when you watch the Fellowship of the Ring you are rendered in awe upon being introduced to the purity and beauty of Middle Earth and darkly enthralled by the majesty of Eisengard, Saruman, Sauron and all of their mighty malice. One of the things that makes this movie so special (and there are so many!) is that you fall in love not only with the ""good"" characters, but also with the ""evil"" ones. For example, Christopher Lee was amazing as Saruman, and I can't imagine the movie without him.

Some films that might be comparable to the Lord of the Rings trilogy are: The Fifth Element, the Star Wars Trilogy parts IV, V and VI (forget the newer prequels), the Matrix trilogy (especially the first part), Interview with a Vampire, the Legend of Sleepy Hollow (with Johnny Depp), Logan's Run and The Island. They are all excellent movies and works of art that weave that movie magic that keeps you spellbound and entranced for the duration of their runtime.

But after seeing The Fellowship of the Ring, I knew I had found the movie by which I would judge all other movies. Based on J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved books, Peter Jackson has set a new standard in the industry of cinema, one that I honestly think has not and won't be surpassed, at least not in my lifetime, not even by PJ himself.

It is truly an instant classic that will stand the test of time and be loved by generations to come. God Bless Tolkien and Jackson and everyone involved in the conception and making of this film, for creating a world that is at my fingertips, only takes the touch of a button to go to whenever I want, and makes me forget everything else.

The LOTR Trilogy is undoubtedly MY precious, the non plus ultra of all movies!"

8. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,10/10,Thank you Mr Jackson,"(95%) If the late 70's early 80's had the Star wars trilogy, then the 2000's had this epic fantasy masterclass. Regardless of whether you're a fantasy fan or not this is too good a movie to simply pass up, and it will be one of those movies that given time will prove it to be a classic. The deeper you look into this the more one notices that every single aspect really is a truly impressive accomplishment. The fact that every single sword used by the main characters was made by hand, with extra ones made only for carrying, fighting, etc, then there's the costumes/armor/props all made by teams of many people. They even made artificial trees for gods sake. But really all those things are just extras, what really makes this a unique watch is that it really does feel huge and sweeping, the sense of scale is fantastic and I can't think of anything that even comes close to matching it. What every epic flick needs this has, the cast is great, it's exciting, it has bags of character, it's funny, sad, superbly well made, with a great score and plenty of action. It's also one of very few 2 hour 30 minute + movies ever that leaves the audience wanting more. Since watching it around Christmas 2001 at a packed out cinema, and the many times I've seen it on DVD since, it never fails to impress and charm. All in all near perfect cinematic treat that keeps on giving."
8. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,10/10,Near perfect adaptation of a fantasy benchmark,
8. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,10/10,An absolutely incredible film!,"Simply incredible. Never before have I seen a 3 hour movie that didn't seem like 3 hours. I read the Lord of the Rings very recently and I was surprised at how similar Peter Jackson's vision was to my own.

Now about the omissions and alterations. I'm not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn't mind Arwen's inflation and I'm actually glad Tom Bombadil was scrubbed (I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).

The acting was flawless. As I've read many many times in other reviews, McKellen doesn't play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat's off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who's intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It's EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.

The special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron's Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.

What's wrong with this movie? I have no idea... I thought everything was perfect. MY biggest gripe is having to wait an entire year to see The Two Towers!"

Galadriel tells Hobbits may look like unimportant people but they will change the course of the future. Story begins with this line.

This line is not really the first line but the line stars the movie for real. This movie is breathtaking. Whatever I say is not enough for this trilogy. Brilliant novel, brilliant adapted screenplay.

Not just the novel or screenplay is excellent but the technics also revolutionary. The trilogy nearly opened a new era to Cinema. Some believed even more revolutionary than Star Wars and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Amazing makeup, breathtaking visual effects, stunning cinematography. The trilogy nearly succeed at all technical subjects."
8. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,10/10,"Part One: With Help, Even the Impossible Can Be Achieved","Peter Jackson set out to make movies which the author of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, J.R.R. Tolkien would have endorsed. All three were resounding successes, though because of the film medium they necessarily varied from Tolkien's story-line. Purists may have issues with Jackson's theatrical license, but as someone who has read Tolkien's books several times and seen the films 4-5 times each, I never felt that Jackson went too far or compromised Tolkien's story, the mythology he developed or the wonderful characters he brought to life. Many have said what Jackson did could not be done. He has not only proved the nay-sayers wrong, but lovingly crafted a set of films which will, for many decades to come, stand out as a great achievement.

This is the first of three reviews I am publishing on IMDb for these films. I am labeling them Parts 1, 2, and 3 just in case anybody wants to read them in order. The reviews will be self-contained, but will also be enhanced by a chronological reading. My reviews will focus on the extended edition DVDs, though my comments are also relevant to the theatrical releases.

The Fellowship of the Ring introduces the key characters and the broad story arc of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Wizard Gandalf the Grey travels to a small town for small people (Hobbits)to help celebrate Bilbo Baggins' birthday. The very elderly Baggins doesn't look a day over 45, and soon it becomes apparent why. Since the great adventure of his life, a quest he was sent on by Gandalf himself, he has possessed the most powerful object in all of Middle Earth  The One Ring.

This ring is evil incarnate, with an insatiable lust for power, it taints every creature who possesses it and tries to work its way back to its creator  Dark Lord Sauron. Bilbo uses the ring to disappear, as he intends to spend his senescence with his friends the Elves in Rivendell. But activating the ring, he draws the attention of Lord Sauron from thousands of miles away in the land of Mordor. Realizing what has occurred, Gandalf scrambles to determine a course of action and recruits Bilbo's nephew Frodo and his loyal gardener Samwise to bear the ring to the Council of Elrond in Rivendell. Thusly, the seeds of the fellowship are planted in the soil of the Shire.

At this point, we are about 1/6th of the way through The Fellowship. Fairly soon thereafter, it becomes clear who will compose the fellowship, and who and what these people are. Though the succeeding films are not entitled ""Fellowship"", they follow the adventures of the surviving central characters. Characterization is done just as Tolkien did it in the original novel  by example not discourse.

For example, we are given hints to the identity of Strider (Mortenson) earlier on in the movie than in the novel, but the actual significance of this remains ambiguous until about midway through. Strong characterization is key to the success of the entire trilogy. To summarize, Peter Jackson, his team and cast  NAIL the characterization.

The casting and acting is perfect. It is very difficult to resist the temptation to single out Mortenson and McKellen for carrying their difficult roles so well (Strider/Aragorn and Gandalf), but why risk diminishing the contributions of the rest of the cast? Nobody mis-steps, and it is clear from the beginning that the entire cast was thoroughly and completed engaged with the task before them.

Tolkien believed that no film would ever do his work justice, and until this trilogy, he was correct.Peter Jackson and his team have managed to do exactly what they set out to. As Jackson himself has said in reference to the film trilogy, they set out to 'make Tolkien's film.' Jackson successfully drew out elements of all three books, expanding and contracting, rearranging, and sometimes adding whole subplots which are hinted at in the books, but not well explained, in order to adopt the grand story to the film medium. Arwen (Liv Tyler), daughter of Elrond and Elven lover of Aragorn, for example, is introduced early in the films and plays a role in the films which is much more equal to her significance than it was in the books.

The Howard Shore score is lovely, and its simple themes are used to great effect throughout all three movies. The musical collaborations improvising on Shore's basic themes are great, and, though they feature some prominent performers  are never weighed down by star-power.

Jackson made all three movies simultaneously. This technique allowed for perfect continuity, and permitted much greater flexibility in editing and post-production work than would normally be allowed. Knowing that he would need to establish and support his own fellowship to make this production work, he also knew that success would make the production legendary. So, he documented the creation of the films beautifully. Two complete DVDs full of documentary pieces are included in all three Special Edition Packages in the trilogy. Many are likely to be bored by the details in these documentaries, but those interested in the creative process behind the films will be provided with a more comprehensive view than I can remember ever seeing in any similar DVD package.

The Fellowship of the Rings is as true a representation of Tolkien's novel as can be imagined. Although some aspects of the stories in the novel were adapted to the screen, the essentials, the characters, and the overall story are not just recognizable, but ENHANCED by the film. What results is a film that is not just entertaining, but an enormous fulfillment of an undying wish of millions of fans around the world.

Very highly recommended."

8. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,10/10,From the beginning...,"...I wasn't sure anyone would have ever guessed (except in a 2004 Fangoria magazine article written by Mexican visionary Guillermo del Toro) that New Zealand native Peter Jackson, the director behind the ""goriest movie ever made"" (1992's ""Dead Alive""), would have been behind the epic three-film installment of ""The Lord of the Rings"" saga, which include ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" (2001), ""The Two Towers"" (2002), and Best Picture Oscar-winner ""The Return of the King"" (2003).

***Note*** This comment applies to all three movies, as it will be posted at each individual web page.

Not since ""Star Wars"" has this much hype surrounded films of this magnitude. But I guess such hype exists because J.R.R. Tolkien's books have one of the largest devoted fanbases of any popular reading material. I've never read Tolkien's original books, though several readers as well as fans of the movies have told me such knowledge is not required when viewing ""The Lord of the Rings"" films. ""The Lord of the Rings"" is the biggest movie I've ever seen, and there's a whole lot of story, 12+ hours to be exact, and I've spent the last two days viewing the extended versions of all three movies and they are breathtaking. There are many dazzling special effects shots over the course of the trilogy and epic battle sequences to put you in awe (many of which, in my view, do push the limits of the ""PG-13"" rating), not because it's action but because of how precise Jackson's direction is, and how unflinching the camera becomes when it's time for battle. The rousing, epic score by Howard Shore helps the viewer get ""into"" Jackson's vision of Middle-earth, and into the characters and on-screen action. Jackson has also breathtakingly transformed his New Zealand homeland into Tolkien's Middle-earth and when you watch these movies, you feel like you're really there, with the rest of its inhabitants. It is also pretty frightening too, with many jump scenes including the frequent and violent battle sequences between our heroes and ""The Enemy,"" who include the brutish Orcs, Moria Orcs, Ringwraiths, and the unreal entity Sauron. And lastly, the cast does much more than bring the action to life, but instead live (""live"" is italicized) their parts. Of course, I'm talking about the young Hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), who come into possession of the ancient One Ring and must journey to the hellish land Mordor to cast the talisman into a river of lava and bring its reign of evil to an end. Along the way, two other Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), necromancer Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (Sean Bean), elf Legalos (Orlando Bloom), and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) aid them in their quest - together as a ""fellowship of the ring."" There are also plenty of other fantastic supporting roles from Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith plays a good guy), and Andy Serkis as the voice of the ever-creepy Gollum. I think J.R.R. Tolkien would be proud of Peter Jackson's take on his material, despite comments I've heard his son has made in undermining the director's vision. Someone once called ""The Lord of the Rings"" the greatest fantasy epic ever made; they were right.

8. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,10/10,I will bring this experience with me for the rest of my life.,
8. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,10/10,A Masterpiece,"I've never been a fan of the sword and sorcery genre . I'm surprised film companies decide to make rubbish like THE BEASTMASTER, HAWK THE SLAYER and RED SONJA but I am aware of the popularity of JRR Tolkien's massive novel LORD OF THE RINGS and of it's popularity , I remember in a survey carried out by a very well known British fantasy/SF magazine in 1987 Tolkien's book was voted the greatest fantasy novel of all time ( THE STAND by Stephen King was a long way second ) , but it's a novel that has always struck me as being read by anoraks who - like fans of STAR TREK and STAR WARS - insist on reading subtexts that are just not there . When the THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS shot to number one in the IMDb top 250 films I put the popularity down to obsessed anorakish fans who were going to vote the film a classic no matter what . Stranger still I found groups as diverse as neo Nazis to gays to enviromentalists proclaiming "" This is our film "" so when I finally sat down to watch TFOTR I was expecting only some average entertainment for a non sad person with no political axe to grind . After seeing the film I had to admit THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is a masterpiece .

Much of the credit must go to the producers . I 've no idea of the politics about bringing the story to the silver screen but I can imagine the Hollywood bigwigs sitting around the commitee table saying "" Give us Tom , give us Nicole , get Harrison , get Leonardo . No limeys . Limeys are slimy . No limey accents . We're Americans , this is our baby "" to which the producers gave a firm and resounding "" No "" . Good for them because the Hollywood treatment would have ruined this film. The cast comprised of well known - but not megastar - actors and unknowns are uniformally excellent even the normally hammy Lee and Rhys Davis and the bland Tyler are good . Also great to see so many Brits playing good guys and having the American actors adopting non specific British accents .The cast do a good job

The other production values are outstanding . Pride of place goes to Andrew Lesnie's cinematography where the camera sweeps down from the sky into the Orcs underground lair and the camera also shows off the stunning New Zealand landscapes . I'd always believed Scotland had the greatest scenery on Earth but I'm willing to change my mind . The FX are good throughout though perhaps the matte backgrounds and CGI are less impressive in places but they're still a lot better than we've been used to recently . The Orc make up is wonderful and helps them become classic cinema monsters . The only bad point about the Orcs is - Like the stormtroopers in STAR WARS - they're too easy to kill .

There are some minor flaws to THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS but this is probably down to Tolkien's source novel rather than the film makers . A couple of times the heroes seem set to suffer a resounding defeat when something not obvious at first like flammable villains or a giant eagle saves the day . I guess this is cancelled out by the dangers and adversaries also appearing from nowhere and there's little female perspective in the story for the women in the audience to relate to but come on girls you've got Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean acting all hunky and macho so you can't complain.

I see the IMDb reviewers have started a backlash against FOTR like they did with TITANIC and GLADIATOR . They're right about the gawd awful rubbish that is TITANIC but they're wrong about GLADIATOR which is a very good film and even further wrong about THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING which is a cinematic masterpiece. Ignore their criticisms . Any film that is praised by people as diverse as fans of the book , people who have never read the book , enviromentalists and cynics like myself is worth your time watching . I'm really looking forward to THE TWO TOWERS"
8. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,10/10,One of the best films ever made.,"A mild mannered hobbit named Frodo, back by eight companions has to face all manner of danger, battling many foes in order to save Middle Earth.

I'm not sure I can say much that hasn't been said multiple times, it truly is one of the greatest movies ever made, foolishly I have only watched it once since its original release, and tonight I was as captivated, entertained and genuinely spellbound as I was when I first saw it.

Action packed, dramatic, emotional and entertaining, this film has it all, there are no lulls, it entertains you from start to finish, an impressive feat for a film that runs over three hours long.

The visuals are sensational, from the glorious landscapes, incredibly costumes and makeup, to the dazzling special effects, you truly are transported to a world of pure fantasy.

The music is spot on too, who doesn't love to hear Enya.

The acting is phenomenal, credit to all involved, Wood, Lee, McKellen, Blanchett, Mortensen and all concerned are terrific, being a huge Sean Bean fan I have to comment on his amazing performance.

It's a fabulous movie.

8. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,10/10,I Don't Know if They Could Do It Much Better,"I am not fanatic, though I have read the books a couple of times. My interest in J. R. R. Tolkien goes to his knowledge of the history of language as well as his work in fantasy. I've seen some of the bad animation that was done using his work. I always assumed that this would be the only vehicle that could be used to bring these works to the screen. Now with a new generation of special effects masters, we have a work of art like the world has never seen. Granted, there can never be a definitive work that matches the depth and poetry of the books, but this captures the charm, the wonder, the amazing epic. To see the Shire presented in the first scenes and the party in the home of Bilbo as the creatures of this amazing fantasy are exposed is one of those incredible moments. The story is set up for the ultimate adventure as Frodo paddles out onto that lake, not knowing what has been set in motion. I will leave the real reviews to others. My first thought upon seeing this was, I just hope I survive to see it to its conclusion.

8. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,10/10,Excellent,"Incredible adaptation of the first book of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. I'm not going to summarize the story--there's way to much going on. All I'll say is they took a verry difficult book with a intricate plot and made it an exciting, totally accesible movie. The film moves quickly (with a few slow spots--but that's to get in the plot) and there's a lot to take in, but I was never confused. I should mention that I tried twice to read the books but found them too hard.

The film looks magical--Middle Earth looks beautifully real. All the special effects are great (the Ring Wraiths are downright terrifying--as they should be) and the action sequences are among the best I've ever seen--fast, long and breathtaking. The film is long (2 hrs, 40 min) but the time flies by. The only problem is that there's so much plot and action going on that you're exhausted by the end--but in a good way.

With the exception of Viggo Mortensen (very wooden) all the actors are good--top honors go to Elijah Wood, Dominic Monaghan, Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler and (especially) Ian McKellan.

But the film is VERY violent (despite the PG-13 rating). It deserves an R--this is NOT one for the kids. Still, it's the best film of 2001. SEE IT!!!!"
8. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,10/10,One ring and three movies to rule them all.,"It took me 14 years and a subscription to HBO Max to get around to watching this movie, and I can certainly say it was worth every bit of hype it gets. The Fellowship of the Ring was an epic start and one of the best fantasy adventure films I've ever seen. These action sequences are immaculate, and it is a gorgeously directed movie, the cinematography was so good I couldn't get enough.

It's also very, very funny, who knew Sean Astin, who I love, would grow up to be a hobbit, every actor in this gives a really great performance, and these special effects are top-tier, they're unbelievable.

The Fellowship of the Ring also has one of the greatest climaxes I've ever seen, not only that, it has incredible creatures that actually scared me.

Yes, it is very, very long with a runtime of nearly 3 hours, but it never drags despite that.

Peter Jackson had a vision here, and it was an amazing vision, along with a story that was epic.

And I'm gonna give Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring an A+"
8. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,10/10,We May Have Forgotten Just How Good This Is,"It's possible we've become too familiar with this film and its two successors. Time, and multiple rewatching as, can cause us to forget how impossible the whole project seemed before the world saw it; we forget how strange and independent spirited parts of it are; we forget the references too and evidence of Jackson's roots in horror cinema; we forget the narrative excitement that propels a film adapted from a source that is more discursive, more of a scene-setter. Changes made from the text aid this, and the result is thrilling and wonder-inducing. It's a masterful piece of epic fantasy cinema, and the whole trilogy's place in my heart is secure.

8. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,10/10,A truly exceptional film,"There is very little that can be said about The Lord of the Rings that hasn't been said already many times over. But what can be re-iterated is that The Fellowship of the Ring is an outstanding piece of film-making.

Where do you start when reviewing a film the size of Lord of the Rings? J.R.R. Tolkein's seminal masterwork, long considered unfilmable, has made it on to the screen thanks to visionary director Peter Jackson. The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of the three books of the trilogy. Everyone has their favourite of the three, and this one is probably mine. Unrivalled in its size and scale by virtually any other film, with new groundbreaking special and digital effects, a stunning musical score, universally superb acting and most importantly a superb story.

The Fellowship of the Ring is the first part of the epic trilogy that tells of the quest of a hobbit to destroy an evil ring of power. He is aided in his quest by his friends and other companions who accompany him and protect him on his journey. Many threats face him on his long journey, both from the world around him and from his companions, who could be tempted by the power of the ring he has set out to destroy. It is a tale of magic and fantasy, swords and sorcery, but it is not simply for teens who enjoy dungeons and dragons games. It is accessible to everyone. By turns exciting, frightening, funny and sad, it is a true masterpiece in terms of storytelling, encompassing the full spectrum of emotions.

The acting is superb from the entire cast, and it is unfathomable as to how the Academy overlooked the acting entirely for all three films when dishing out awards and nominations. However the performances from Ian McKellan, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Elijah Wood and Sean Bean are all so good it would have possibly been greatly unfair to single any one out for an award.

The film also contains some groundbreaking computer-generated special effects, and some positively genius scale work. Due to hobbits being only about 3 feet tall, some clever scale work was needed in order to ensure that John Rhys-Davies, a dwarf in the film but over 6 feet tall in real life, did in fact look the height of a dwarf. This was done through clever use of forced perspectives, scale doubles, giant sets and blue screen filming. However, the most impressive use of computer effects lies later in the trilogy, with the appearance of Gollum  cinema's first live-action character who is completely computer generated. The music is also beautiful, and Howard Shore has created possibly the most iconic and memorable score since John Williams' Star Wars.

Peter Jackson has, until Lord of the Rings, been seen as a director outside of the mainstream, but his superb, career-defining work on the Lord of the Rings trilogy has seen him well and truly propelled him to the forefront of Hollywood. He has re-defined the epic film with unparalleled success, and created films that will definitely stand the test of time, to one day be thought of with the same reverence as the Star Wars and Godfather trilogies.

A major milestone in cinema history, the trilogy would eventually gain seventeen Oscars between the three films. Lord of the Rings is a master class in storytelling, and essential viewing."
8. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,10/10,"Never read the book, but loved the movie!","I didn't know quite what to expect when I went into the theater, all I knew is that I wanted to see a fantasy film with sword fights, magic and monsters. I was not disappointed. It exceeded my expectations because it had all the stuff I mentioned and great acting, and good character development as well. I was enjoying the movie so much that I was very disappointed when it ended. I would have gladly stayed another six hours if the showed the next two installments of this flick. That was the only bad part of the film is the abrupt ending, but I still give this movie a 10, because it is a trilogy and I was expecting it. If you want to see a great movie, one that delivers where so many have promised, but failed to deliever then this is the film to see...even if you didn't read the book. And for anyone who has read the book I would love to hear your take on the movie, just don't give anything away about the next two parts.

9. Good Will Hunting,10/10,Incredible,"I don't think I have been this moved by a movie in a while. Good Will Hunting is an incredible movie and if I had to say what I think is Gus Van Sant's best film, this would be it. It is a slow-burner, but I think this was purposefully done and it added to the film's poignancy and psychological aspect.

Good Will Hunting is a beautifully filmed movie with striking scenery, and it is directed wonderfully by Van Sant. The music is never obtrusive but never too low-key either, while the story is interesting and compelling and the script intelligently written.

The acting is one of the film's best assets, as well as its compellingly real characters. Robin Williams is superb in one of his best ""drama"" roles, while Ben Affleck has never been better and Matt Damon gives another fine performance to match his performance in The Talented Mr Ripley. Minnie Driver is also quite touching and believable.

All in all, an incredible movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
9. Good Will Hunting,10/10,"A slow burner, a fine achievement","Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.

Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.

I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.

Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.

You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.

The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.

As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it's second to none. A fine achievement."
9. Good Will Hunting,9/10,Beautiful,"I return to this movie from time to time for the last two decades. I do not like Damon and Affleck, but this is their lifetime achievement and the most deserved Oscar they will ever win. Beautiful drama about finding yourself, finding a balance between the essence of life and its everyday appearance, about love and friendship. Realistic, unpretentiously philosophical and warm movie about life. Two main trumps of this movie are its perfect script and brilliant Robin Williams, the actor that adds warmth and love in everything he does. I can not say it's a masterpiece of cinematography, but it surely is beautiful, intelligent and it never gets old.

9. Good Will Hunting,8/10,Its central performances are phenomenal and its inevitable emotional release is truly powerful.,"The genius of 'Good Will Hunting (1997)' isn't in its plotting or its resolution or even its character arcs per say (which are all a little formulaic or clichéd to an extent), but rather in the nuanced and realistic journey that that these almost fully-formed people take to reach the conclusions you know they eventually will. The two central performances are nothing short of phenomenal. Williams' subtly wise and humorous demeanour exudes fatherly knowledge as a man of experience and Damon's frustratingly yet understandably closed-off defensiveness makes his inevitable emotional release truly powerful. The writing rounds them off in ways which make them feel honest, imperfect and, most importantly, real. 8/10

9. Good Will Hunting,10/10,The Genius In Our Midst,"So many personal projects of our best players never come out quite right. The vision they have somehow doesn't translate to the screen, or it's not box office subject matter, or maybe the actors aren't gifted with writing or directing talent. That's certainly not the case with Good Will Hunting which was not only the breakthrough film for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, but it will probably remain their most personal endeavor.

Not too much imagination was required though because these guys set this film in their native Boston the city they grew up in, the city they seem to know every nook and cranny of. They didn't even have to lose the New England accents they would have to in most of their other films.

When Matt and Ben wrote Good Will Hunting the fact they were able to interest a top director like Gus Van Sant in the project should have said something before one views a frame of film. Van Sant got an Oscar nominated performance for Matt Damon and a Supporting Actor Oscar for Robin Williams as the psychologist who counsels Damon.

Will Hunting is this average lower middle class kid from South Boston who was in the foster care system and suffered a lot of abuse while growing up. He has some low level jobs, he's constantly getting in trouble with the law for minor scrapes, and he's a functioning genius who for kicks solves a highly complex mathematical equation between buffing floors at MIT.

Which perks the interest of Stellan Skarsgaard highly touted mathematics professor there. He feels and I agree with him that one of the worst sins in the world is wasting the talent the Deity blesses you with, whatever it is. After a succession of therapists who are unable to cope with Damon's genius, Robin Williams gets his turn at bat.

Robin Williams one of the wildest, wackiest, most innovative comics that ever walked the earth, drops all of that to deliver a highly sensitive performance as the psychologist who finally reaches Damon on some level. What Damon does with it is for you to see Good Will Hunting for.

Some of that breakthrough is achieved with the help of Minnie Driver, a British student at Harvard who falls hard for the blue collar Will Hunting. Most of it is achieved though in the film's key scene as Ben Affleck tells him that no matter what your IQ is, if you don't use it and move up and on, you're the stupidest guy here. It's one of Affleck's best scenes in his whole career on film.

I've known a few Will Huntings in my day, blessed with talent I would like to have had and who threw it away for a combination of reasons. One in particular I knew back in the Eighties was a kid who originally grew up in Virginia in the Blue Ridge Mountain country to some really uneducated hicks. They discovered he was gay and immediately had him committed. Back in the day, they did all kinds of things to him like electroshock therapy and guess what, it all didn't work. But it left him a twisted and bitter person who gravitated to the new gay rights movement because it was something that finally validated him as a human being.

He also was blessed with an incredible baritone singing voice, he could have sang opera had that been trained instead of his parents trying to change his orientation. But when I last saw him in the middle Eighties no one had or could reach him. He made a living running a cleaning service for apartments. If he couldn't sing militant songs of protest he wasn't interested, even if he could have reached millions more with his issues had he studied, learned, and developed.

Unlike Will Hunting, Jimmy Flowers wasn't reached as far as I know. But Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in writing their Oscar winning original screenplay could have known him. So I'm sure they won't mind if I dedicated this review to Jimmy whether he's alive or no longer with us.

I'm sure there are Jimmy Flowers and Will Huntings that we've all known and hopefully we have the wit to recognize the talent whatever it is and the encouraging nature to make people develop that talent."
9. Good Will Hunting,10/10,This movie has a brilliant script...,"It appears the jury is hung... many people either loved or hated this movie. I can tell you why I loved it. First of all the script. I think it had a real slice of life, and brilliance in it. Sorry, but some people do use 4 letter words to express themselves. And no, it doesn't mean that's because they lack intelligence to use anything else. I can rise to the occasion any time I need w/out profanity. But it is how I think & speak in my day to day life. The language shouldn't even be an issue. If that's all you heard, you weren't listening! The brilliance in it is everywhere. For example, William's character putting Damon's character in place by noting that he sneers at things that he has no real life experience with. I know people like that. Then moments when he (William's character) says gems like, ""I'll save you the suspense sport- she isn't perfect & neither are you- the question is whether you are perfect for each other."" I'm paraphrasing of course. The question of relationships, and life career decisions- the courage to risk and overcoming whatever your background is, are all a part of real life. This isn't supposed to be about genius or some ""white trash"" as someone else said (some people might say the kids in this movie aren't trash, just normal hard working, middle class guys) - it's about love, life and courage- courage to ante up & try again, no matter how many times life knocks us around. The acting, direction and script are wonderful. They definitely deserved the Oscar for this. It has soul. It has meaning & I am sad for the people that didn't get it. As the movie ""American Beauty"" said... LOOK CLOSER."

9. Good Will Hunting,10/10,Good Will Hunting Review,"Will Hunting a janitor at M. I. T has a gift for learning, but his genius is going to waste because he can't seem to find his purpose in life.

Back in 2019 I had went to Boston to see the Celtics and the Bruins, and the hotel I was staying at had a pillow with ""wicked smaht"" stitched on to it. I remember my dad seeing it and immediately saying the iconic line ""my boys wicked smaht"", and I asked him what that was from. He told me it was from a classic movie called Good Will Hunting that takes place in Boston. So, with my curiosity peaked I returned home and watched it for the first time. Since then I have seen this film 5 times and it has become one of my all time favourite films.

From top to bottom this film is perfection. Matt Damon and Robin Williams give what I considered the best performances of their careers, along with two very strong performances from Ben Affleck and Stellan Skarsgard. The writing is incredible and the dialogue in particular is phenomenal. The cinematography and direction by Gus Can Sant is perfect throughout the entire film, and the music to accompany it is beautiful.

What makes this film for me is that it is something we can all relate to. This film is about finding yourself and finding a purpose for your life, everyone on the planet at one point or another needed to seriously consider the question ""who am I"". That for me is an extremely powerful message and why this film is so great.

10/10 A+"
9. Good Will Hunting,10/10,"A Sensitive, Remarkable Look at Genius","Matt Damon's Will Hunting couldn't be more complex. He is an utter genius. Unfortunately, he has enough baggage to send him around the world. Will is a brilliant mathematician, smarter than many of the professors at MIT. However, he is depressed and self destructive. He gives up the minute things get hard. He can't relate to others, especially women. After many failures to help him, he hooks up with a man who respects him (but who also fears his insights) played by Robin Williams in one of his finer dramatic roles. He pushes Will and Will pushes back. The interaction between two imperfect, but brilliant, human beings is the core of this movie. Created by Damon and Ben Affleck, this was probably the best movie of the year. Will Hunting is searching for happiness, as are we all, but others have decided what that happiness looks like. He is indeed ""hunting"" for joy in his life. Excellent performances all around.

9. Good Will Hunting,8/10,Two Pals Make Good in Hollywood,"Matt Damon and Ben Affleck scored quite a success with their interesting and entertaining script. The introduction and exposition sections are enormously engrossing, after which script peaks and rather coasts along the rest of the way. Yet, the casting is so well done, and the acting at such good level, that interest is nicely maintained.

What ""Hunting"" essentially consists of is some two dozen conversational scenes, bridged together with short transitions of physical activity. What is rather remarkable is that one isn't aware of the dramatic limitations comprising the structure. This is a real tribute to the cast, director, and of course, the script. While the basic situation is really quite far-fetched, it is made to seem plausible--again, the mark of good, convincing writing. The story behind getting the script sold and produced on the terms of the writers' preferences is fascinating. Still, one can't really call it luck, for both Damon and Affleck ""paid their dues"" -- and success did not just fall into their laps. These are two talented young men, with perseverance; and how wonderful for them to have achieved such success while still youthful and full of vitality.

""Good Will Hunting"" is a good production, with solid craftsmanship in all departments -- thanks to the creativity of Damon and Affleck."
9. Good Will Hunting,8/10,The best of Affleck/Damon.,"A Janitor at a College hides an incredible mathematical gift, a psychologist named Sean is brought in to unlock his talents, and do what nobody else has been able to do.

Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are two of my favourite actors, and often when they combine they deliver the goods, Air is an example, but to this day, Good Will hunting is still their best offering.

This is a totally captivating and emotionally engaging movie, it's a great story, and features some superb performances.

It's so cleverly written, it works because the characters are so well drawn, Will is essentially wild, angry, afraid to let anyone get near him, Will is perfectly believable.

I love the way Sean and Lambeau look at Will through the lenses of their own lives, it's so clever, each thinking they know what's best for him.

One of Robin Williams best, I still find his death so unbelievably sad, an incredible talent, he brought his A game to the table here, phenomenal, as is Damon, the scenes the pair share are extraordinary.

8/10."
9. Good Will Hunting,9/10,Ranked 87th on the site though it is better than at least 1/3 of films rated higher on here,"I watched this movie for the third time today and it was just as powerful to me, if not more so, than when I saw it upon its release.

Gripping story and characters.

Superb acting all-around.

Robin Williams earned every ounce of his Oscar and his grand performance here is one of the great efforts in movie history. It's one of those roles that should be replayed every year at the Oscars ceremony along with Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca and Gene Kelly in Singin' in the Rain. Williams is not the lead actor but his interplay with Matt Damon in the key scene near the finale is one of the best film history has to offer us.

As most should know, Damon wrote the script with a young Ben Affleck. Affleck's younger brother Casey has a solid supporting role as well. Cole Hauser, who acted with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon in the 1992 film School Ties, has a small role but makes an impression. Hauser also acted with Ben Affleck in Dazed and Confused (1993) and I assume must be a real-life friend of both.

Minnie Driver is really great in a difficult role.

I have a small problem with a couple of the lines (particularly the bar scene) which I won't give away but it knocks the movie down a half point. Some parts of the story are just not believable. There is some tongue and cheek humor and a few things that might seem implausible today but were realistic in 1997.

The brilliance of the writing, the youthful energy and the power of the performances (along with a great soundtrack that features the haunting songs of the late Elliott Smith) make this a landmark film for a generation - especially those who came of age in the 1990's."
9. Good Will Hunting,10/10,Thought provoking classic,"One of the movies which turned Robin Williams into a legend! He proved in this movie that he is as good in his dramatic roles as in his comedic routines. Pair that with a great performance from Matt Damon as the tittle character and an inspiring story built upon the everyday struggle of the characters and you got yourself a 90's cinematic classic.

9. Good Will Hunting,10/10,A Movie About Men: The Internal Fight Club,"Why another review? Well, for the few that might read this, I find this movie very accurate about the state of seeing a counselor. It is also very accurate about a man who carries deep toxic shame within keeping him from intimacy with others and living with massive defense mechanisms. Because of this, I understand why some do not like this movie, it taps a part of themselves they are still running from, and that is why this movie is so powerful.

It is very hard to believe two 25yos wrote this script with such realistic relational depth. There are some very powerful emotional dynamics in this movie--the scene with Will & Skyler in her apartment when Will unpacks. The monumental scene with Will and Sean ""It's not your fault""--when a movie is a template for real life, this is an epic work of art! This movie allowed people to talk and relate when emotions were road blocks, to point to a scene in Good Will Hunting to establish a base for communication.

Here's a point in real time. I was writing this review and a friend called. He ended up hanging up the phone on me because I questioned him about a project. He did a ""Will"" in Skyler's room on me because I tapped a dark shadow in his life. His sensitivity to being questioned is such a part of his identity he is unconscious about, but something that causes him great conflict in his marriage which is now a divorce, his inability to stay employed, and history with addiction.

This movie lays a template for men's issues!"

9. Good Will Hunting,10/10,A Great Script And Fine Acting,"This is the film that put Matt Damon and Ben Affleck on the map, winning them an Oscar for their screenplay. It's a wonderful script about a young man with extraordinary talents whose rough upbringing undermines his opportunities.

Matt Damon plays Will Hunting, a polymath with an eidetic memory who works as a custodian at MIT. He lives by both his wits and his fists. Minnie Driver plays Skylar, the university student who falls for the brash young man. And Robin Williams, in an Oscar-winning performance, plays Sean, the community college instructor who dares to confront Will's demons. All three are tremendous.

Damon and Affleck know Boston and they imbue the story with blue-collar authenticity. The film understands the anti-intellectualism of some of its characters (compare ""Breaking Away"") but also celebrates the upper limits of scholarship and prodigious abilities. Will is actually an anti-intellectual intellectual.

This is one of the best films of its decade. There, I said it. How do you like them apples?"

I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!

The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn't enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. ""The Dark Knight"" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want.

10. The Dark Knight,10/10,Watch the IMAX version if you can,"I had the pleasure to watch this movie in an IMAX theatre in London (it advertises itself, with the slogan ""Biggest screen in the UK""), which was one of the greatest movie experiences I had in my life. And it was my first movie in an IMAX theatre. I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.

The movie could also have been called ""The Joker"", but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And ""The Dark Knight"" is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote. This is the best Batman movie ever (until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one)!"

10. The Dark Knight,10/10,Best superhero movie of all time,
10. The Dark Knight,10/10,"Surpasses ""Begins"" in every aspect!!!","Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress"" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins"" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal. Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake. Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor. Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008."
10. The Dark Knight,10/10,Perfect balance between action and drama with an unforgettable villain,
10. The Dark Knight,9/10,Heath Ledger,"If someone else acted as Joker, I would give the movie 7-8 stars. The majority of people ended up loving the villain more than the hero, and that rarely happends in movies.

Rest in peace Heath Ledger.

Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart adds a good performance as Harvey Dent. In the end, this is Heath Ledger's movie. He overpowers everybody. His early death may have immortalized him, but my opinion isn't inflated. His presence is electric. It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating. Heath Ledger makes this movie great. And it surpasses the series reboot 'Batman Begins'.

After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".

Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.

Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.

Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?

Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the ""Batman"" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in ""Batman Forever"", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.

Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.

""The Dark Knight"" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars."

However, I must say that this movie is much more than just a superhero movie. If you don't like superhero movie but want to watch a good drama/action movie then this is one of the best.

10. The Dark Knight,10/10,Mindblowing,"I thought I was getting a clever comic book movie. Instead, I got a profound, chilling introspection on good vs evil with allegorical references to God vs Satan, good vs evil, and social-political and true life realities that made me cry as the credits rolled at just the powerful, brilliant fil experience it was.

I was enthralled and mesmerized with what the director and writers were doing to something that was only supposed to be a Batman movie. I've now seen it at least 10 times, and I still get the same feeling. This is big budget, blockbuster filmmaking at its absolute best for the ages, a top 10 movie of all-time.

10. The Dark Knight,10/10,Heath Ledger is a ledgend!,"Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.

Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heath's other films like '10 Things I Hate About You' and even 'Brokeback Mountain' proves that this man could actually act, doesn't matter what character, he could do it.

The film's storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder what's next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.

During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess that's why they called it the 'Dark' Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.

The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.

Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face's face in the many moods he displayed.

Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.

This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledger's life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.

I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. It's great!"

The Dark Knight,8/10,"Knock, Knock...","There's a villain, full of colour, takes to the stage, a double crossing trickster seeks to enrage, a Mafioso kind of broker, it's the one and only Joker, hands of torment, turmoil, torture's what he'll rage. A triumvirate of Gotham forms a cordon, The Batman, Harvey Dent, Lieutenant Gordon, but they're seduced by the performance, limited by laws conformance, the playmaker relishing, all the destruction. It's not too long before their weaknesses are found, as hostages are taken to compound, ultimatums are presented, prominent profiles are demented, and our hero runs for cover, goes underground.

*quality of acting* #9 excellent - Bale is the gold standard Batman, gruff, tough, aloof, positively fueled by the tragedies of his dark past. Ledger is the nightmare villain, twisted, evil, unapologetic, irrational, completely void of a moral compass

*quality of writing* #10 perfection - one of those movies you wish you could have a memory edit in order to watch again and again

11. Fight Club,10/10,Superb,"Superb, and truly one of the greatest movies of all time.

It starts with the screenplay. Adapted from, and very faithful to, an excellent book. The book by Chuck Palahniuk was perfect for a movie: vivid, powerful, challenging, original, unpredictable. Considering how perfectly formed the book already was, the screenplay would have been a doddle.

Some very interesting themes are explored - consumerism, class warfare, multiple-personality disorder, male bonding, terrorism and anarchy - without being judgemental.

Direction is spot-on. Perfect cinematography, pacing and editing. The twists and nuances of the book are captured perfectly.

Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are perfectly cast as the two lead characters, and deliver in spades. Helena Bonham Carter is a strange selection to take on the role of Marla, as she tends to act in Shakespearean dramas and other period pieces. However, despite this, her performance is very convincing.

An absolute classic."

11. Fight Club,10/10,Fincher's tour de force is a bruising assault on the senses,
11. Fight Club,10/10,Welcome to movie heaven!,"Let's ignore the advice and talk about ""Fight Club"". This film was a milestone; although it bombed at the box office, Fincher's cinematic language left a mark that can still be felt now, 14 years later, on many current releases. Despite the risky 'cutting edge' nature of the film, Fincher got a huge budget for this and it shows: the camera effects and the whole production design are amazing.

This movie has a raw energy that grips me every time I watch it. What a crazy, fun ride! Whether it is a very clever satire or pure testosterone going on a rampage - both are fine by me. A film so visually stunning and sexy, with career best performances by all involved - welcome to movie heaven.

11. Fight Club,10/10,It's one of the best.,"An Office worker spends his time looking for fulfilment in various support groups, when he randomly encounters a soap maker named Tyler Durden, the pair discover a mutual, but strange and violent past time.

There is no doubt in my mind, Fight Club is one of the best films of all time, a story like no other, even for someone that doesn't care for this film, I'm sure they'd agree that it's original.

Fight Club is fast paced, action packed, intriguing, sexy, revealing and timeless, it's one of those films that it doesn't matter how many times you watch it, it doesn't lose any of its appeal. At times it is genuinely outrageous, and therein is its monumental appeal.

Helena Bonham Carter steals so many films, and she's terrifiic here, but it's the combination of Ed Norton and Brad Pitt that makes the film, they are outstanding, I still think it's Norton's best performance to date.

The wonderful, late Meatloaf adds a nice bit of humour.

The moral of Fight Club......don't have the soup.

However, going into this film I had already had had some of the major twists spoiled for me, and this is a movie that relies so heavily on those twists that knowing them will detract from the experience significantly. Because of that, the film is really only worth seeing of you have no prior knowledge of it whatsoever.

11. Fight Club,9/10,"You love it or you hate it, personally I loved it","Perhaps a little too long, but Fight Club is just a very well-made, brilliantly written and superlatively performed film. Essentially a satirical fable, it tells of an insomniac loser teaming up with a seditious soap salesman to form a no-holds-barred-fight club as an outlet for their direction-less aggression. This concept is an intriguing and original one, and works really well. Then there is the script, it is absolutely superb, with dialogue that will make you both laugh and think. Fight Club is very well made, with elaborate production design, great editing and startling images. David Fincher's direction is brilliantly handled and the performances of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are superb. Overall, just a great film, a mesmerising ride through the 1990s male psyche. 9/10 Bethany Cox

11. Fight Club,10/10,HOW THIS IS NOT EVERYONE'S FAVORITE MOVIE IS BESIDE ME,"I first saw Fight Club when I was 8 years old. I didn't understand any of it, but I liked the fighting and editing.

I saw it again when I was 13 and just started seeing movies for what they were - a language. A language through which the filmmakers interpret their own views on the world. I understood more of it, especially being part of ""the middle children of history"" generation.

After that, I saw it at least once per year and every single time, I realized something new or different about it, and the world itself. I grew with this movie both intellectually and spiritually.

Still took me another 12 years to understand this movie is THE textbook for Jungian psychology BESIDES already being the single greatest social critique of the consumer era.

It's ridiculously smart, deep, beautiful and cool. I've watched basically every movie out there, and nothing comes even close to the degree of greatness of Fight Club."
11. Fight Club,9/10,The things you own end up owning you.,"I wasn't prepared for an existential trip about life. I thought it was just going to be about fighting. I was wrong.

The line in my title grabbed me because I have always thought about ""stuff"" and how it ties you down. People can't get divorced when the love is gone because of ""stuff."" People can't move to a better location because of ""stuff."" ""Stuff"" is choking us all.

It is like the Kipling poem:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it all on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings And never breath a word about your loss;

then you will be a man!

Besides, ""stuff."" we are chocked by consumerism; which may be the same thing. The film is replete with phallic symbols and decries the femininization of men.

""We're a generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need.""

Fight Club gives us an emphatic NO to that question. But, then, what is Marla's role? To show us that we are lying to ourselves? Hmmm.

This film had brilliant performances by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter, under the superb direction of David Fincher. It deserves multiple watchings."

11. Fight Club,9/10,It's Hard to Take Your Eyes Away,"I'm not much into graphic violence. This film transcends that. It has wonderful direction, and, even though it is brutal, it takes things to another ledge. Edward Norton is really controlled as he realizes his power. It's too easy to throw in spoilers so I will leave things to the viewer. The search for self and the growing cult around Fight Club made me suspicious. Still, to watch what happens to the two men at the center and what they are without Fight Club is the core. One of the neat things about this film is seeing it a second town makes it even better. The mental byplay between Pitt and Norton increases tension to explosiveness. If you want to see what can happen to a story when put in masterful hands, read the book (which is outstanding), and see the movie. They show that art forms can treat the same material, each in their own ways.

11. Fight Club,10/10,My first review about my favorite movie...,"If you read the opinions about the film from different sites from different people, you can find out that basically you will either adore ""Fight Club"", or in the opposite direction you will dislike it to the same extent. I am one of the first. Moreover, this is probably my favorite movie.

I liked everything here - from the actors' acting to the plot itself or the production of shots. The film is at least memorable and obviously will not leave anyone indifferent. The plot and motivation of the characters have long been known to everyone, if not, then it's for the best, a brief description and understanding will be enough for you.

It's up to you to decide whether to watch or not. For me, according to the assessment and the above-written - ""... favorite movie ... "" I do not need to write a lot about my opinion.

Speaking about this particular painting, it is difficult to say anything. Each person will accept it in their own way. But if you look objectively, you can see that this is a classic and most are delighted. And isn't that a reason to try it anyway?)"
11. Fight Club,10/10,a dangerously brilliant film that entertains as well as enlightens.,"""Fight Club"" an aggressive, confrontational, often brutal satire that is quite possibly a brilliant masterpiece. Taking the ""Choose life,"" anti-consumerism rant at the beginning of ""Trainspotting,"" and carrying it to its logical -- albeit extreme -- conclusion this is a big budget, mainstream film that takes a lot of risks by biting the hand that feeds it. The film's narrator (Edward Norton) is an insignificant cog in the drab, corporate machine, dutifully doing his job and what he's told without question. He's an insomniac slave to his IKEA possessions and only finds joy in going to as many self-help/dealing with terminal diseases sessions as he can. It provides him with an escape from his sleepless nights. That is, until Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a trashy chain-smoking poser, enters his life and upsets his routine. The narrator also meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic soap salesman whose straightforward honesty, candor and sleazy lounge-lizard outfits are a breath of fresh air. One night, after the two men have bonded over beers, Tyler asks the narrator to hit him. At first, it seems like an absurd request but after they pound on each other for a bit, a strange feeling overcomes them. They feel a kind of release and satisfaction at inflicting pain on one another. In a world where people are desensitized to everything around them, the physical contact of fighting wakes them up and makes them feel truly alive. Others soon join in and pretty soon Fight Club becomes an underground sensation. However, it becomes readily apparent that Tyler has more elaborate plans than just organizing brawls at the local bar. David Fincher has taken the dark, pessimistic worldview of ""Seven"" and married it with the clever plot twists and turns of ""The Game"" and assembled his strongest effort to date. ""Fight Club"" is a $50+ million studio film that remains true to its anti-consumer, anti-society, anti-everything message -- right up to the last, sneaky subliminal frame. What makes ""Fight Club"" a subversive delight is not only its refreshing anti-corporate message but how it delivers said message. As Fincher has explained in interviews, you don't really watch the film but rather download it. Its structure is extremely playful as it messes around with linear time to an incredible degree. The narrative bounces back and forth all over the place like a novel, or surfing on the Internet -- even making a hilarious dead stop to draw attention to itself in a funny, interesting way that completely works. Yet Norton's deadpanned narration holds everything together and allows the viewer to get a handle on what's happening. This is the way films should be made. Why must we always have to go through the A+B+C formula? ""Fight Club"" openly rejects this tired, clearly outdated structure in favour of a stylized frenzy of jump cuts, freeze frames, slow motion and every other film technique in the book that only reinforces its anarchistic message. A film like this would have never been greenlighted by a major studio if Brad Pitt had not been attached to the project. Once you see the film, it becomes obvious that he was the only choice for Tyler Durden. Like he did with ""Kalifornia"" and ""Twelve Monkeys"", Pitt grunges himself down and disappears completely into his role to a frighteningly convincing degree. During many of the brutal fight scenes, he is transformed into a bloody, pulpy mess that'll surely have the ""Legends of the Fall"" fans running for the exits. It is an incredible performance -- probably his best -- for the simple fact that he becomes the character so completely. If Pitt has the flashy, gonzo role, Edward Norton is his perfect foil as the seemingly meek yet sardonic narrator. It's a deceptively understated performance as the last third of the film reveals but Norton nails it perfectly. He is clearly our surrogate, our introduction into this strange world and his wry observations on our consumer-obsessed culture are right on the money. They are the perfect setup for Tyler's introduction and his view on the world which is clearly a call to arms of sorts, a manifesto that rejects the notion that we are what we own. And ultimately, that is what ""Fight Club"" tries to do. The film is a cinematic punch to the head as it challenges the status quo and offers a wakeup call to people immersed in a materialistic world where those who have the most stuff, ""win."" I think that Fincher's film wants us to tear all that down, reject corporate monsters like Starbucks and Blockbuster, and try to figure out what we really want out of life. It's almost as if the film is suggesting salvation through self-destruction. And it is these thought-provoking ideas that makes ""Fight Club"" a dangerously brilliant film that entertains as well as enlightens."
11. Fight Club,10/10,I study philosophy but this film took me for a ride,"I watched the first hour and a half of this movie when I was 16 before I asked my boyfriend to turn it off because it was too dark.

Everything from the plot, the acting, even the damn lighting of every scene is art. I cannot believe I was not pushed to rewatch it sooner. I writing this as 1am because I cant stop thinking about it. It will seep into my dreams and I'm not sure if that is terrifying or thrilling. Maybe both

11. Fight Club,10/10,A unique film,"Fight Club is one of the most unique films I have ever seen. In addition to presenting a rather fresh take on life, FC also presents its material in a fresh way. My main interest in the film is in that, in my opinion, it does not present characters for us to think about. Rather, it presents actions for us to think about. I will say that I cannot recall *ever* having been ""asked"" by a film to both suspend my disbelief the way this film asks in its third act AND at the same time come to terms with an understanding that there is no room--or need--for disbelief.

Perhaps these comments will not make sense to the average movie goer who will dismiss this film--and, unfortunately, its premise--as another hollywood flick filled with gratuitous violence. I'd go as far as to say that this film is not about violence. It is about choices. It is about activity. It is about lethargy. It is about waking up and realizing that at some point in the past we've gone to the toilet and thrown up our dreams without even realizing that society has stuck its fingers down our throat.

I would argue that anyone caught, at some point in their lives, between a rock and a hard place--anyone who has reached bottom on a mental level--anyone who has uttered to themselves ""Wait, this isn't right. I would not do/say/feel what it is that I just did/said/felt... I do not like this. I must change before I am forever stuck being the person that I am not."" These people, they will know what I'm talking about. These people will not only recognize the similarities between Edward Norton's character and themselves--they will be uncomfortably familiar with him. These people will appreciate Fight Club for what it is: a wake up call that we are not alone.

As David Berman once said: ""I'm afraid I've got more in common with who I was than who I am becoming."" If this sentence makes any sense to you, go see Fight Club. You won't regret it.

11. Fight Club,7/10,The first rule of Fight Club: You never talk about how over-hyped Fight Club is,"I'm not sure if it's just the fact that Ed Norton really grates on me in this film, but I never really bought into the idea of Fight Club being some kind of cultural phenomenon. Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.

12. Whiplash,10/10,Whiplash is a modern day masterpiece.,"I don't say that often, in fact...never. There aren't enough superlatives to describe the amazingness of Whiplash. Damien Chazelle crafted not just a tense dramatic piece of cinema, but a thematic experience with layered subtext. Andrew is a college student who simply wants to be the best drummer. Terence Fletcher, a renowned teacher at said college, sees potential in Andrew and chooses him to be the drummer in his band, at the expense of emotional distress. This is a brutal character study, absolutely savage. This is about Fletcher as much as it is about Andrew. The psychological battle and the consequential emotional turmoil that follows. I've never been so compelled in a drama ever (and this is my 5th viewing). The strive for perfection amidst the continuous passion that elevates Andrew as a person and how Fletcher uses his passion in attempt to obtain the perfect musician that Andrew hopes to be. The struggle for perfection is difficult in any profession, there is no right or wrong way to achieve this; the question is: ""is there a line between gently pushing someone towards a goal or inflicting emotional torture upon them?"". Fletcher leans towards the latter, so much so that he actually imposes physical damage to Andrew to test whether he will be discouraged from the harsh reality of perfection or not. The internal struggle in Andrew is excellently conveyed, you can see his passion seeping through the blood, sweat and tears and yet mentally unable to cope with Fletcher's methods. A simple story, but executed with such ferocity and intelligence that it just feels fresh. Damien Chazelle directed the heck out of this. Quick cuts between the musical instruments and nice long takes of Miles Teller and J.K Simmons duelling in anger. Speaking on Simmons, the best performance I've seen in years. Both complicated and terrifying simultaneously, he deserved every award. Teller was near perfect as well, conveying innocence and vulnerability. Look, I can talk about Whiplash forever. It's a masterpiece. End of review."
12. Whiplash,9/10,This is review #572....so is there really any need to say more?!,"""Whiplash"" is a terrific film...no doubt about that.

It's the 40th highest rated film on IMDb after all!

J.K. Simmons clearly deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor because although he was no the star of the film, he dominated every moment he was on the screen. Was he a likable guy? No way..but he was mesmerizing. Kudos also for the young actor in the lead and everyone else with this film. It's among the best films of the year and one that impressed me so much because it did not have a complicated script of mega-million dollar special effects--it just had terrific acting, writing and direction. See this film and see how a quality film is crafted. 'Nuff said...

12. Whiplash,10/10,An important hardened lesson in resilience and when to stop measuring up to your mentor. Whiplash is a captivating study of ambition.,"Taking the festival circuit by storm since its Sundance premiere in January, Whiplash is starting to feel like the underdog that could go far with its crowd-pleasing intensity. On the surface, it's a gritty story about a brutal student-mentor relationship that oversteps boundaries. Underneath, it's a piercing examination of the psyche of unbridled ambition. Whiplash is a film that stops at nothing. As a result, it's the best film I've seen in years, and I say that without hesitation. This is a film that resonates on every single level and every moment counts. If writer/director Damien Chazelle was striving for greatness as much as his protagonist, then he has achieved it.

Miles Teller, who's been steadily growing on me since The Spectacular Now, stars as Andrew Neyman, a 19-year-old aspiring jazz drummer who's pushed and inspired by the abuse and aspirations of his school band leader Fletcher, played by the ferocious J.K. Simmons like we've never seen him before. Chazelle has described the film as an origin story to the jazz musicians of the golden age, and it thrives on the myths of jazz heroes such as Charlie Parker. They're urgently looking for the next Parker, in search of perfection. But with that comes a great irony. The music genre is known as one for freedom of expression but here the jazz is soulless and mechanical, and that clouds the ethical judgment of the characters. Even so, Fletcher is a man who can tell if you have the right tempo within a bar. Although most of the audience for the film may not know much about music including myself, you get a feel for what he's looking for and when someone's wrong even if you don't know why. Simmons is as good as they say he is. He's a force of nature, with a terrifying presence that incites the fear Bryan Cranston achieved with the peak of his Walter White. But it's not a one-note performance. Simmons is still subversive with moments of weakness, insecurity, approachability, and he also sometimes brings in the lightness he's known for in other roles with Jason Reitman, exec producer here.

Even though he's an unlikeable character with nothing nice to say, he's still somewhat endearing and enigmatic, much like R. Lee Ermey's drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket. This demasculinisation through a barrage of insults is a theme explored in Whiplash and it argues whether it's a crime or an 'ends justifying the means' factor of life. It's not just a music film, but also one that adapts to the elements of sports training, war at boot camp and biopic genres with the way it frames its elements. Fletcher is representative of the devil on our shoulders that yells at us that we're not good enough and that symbolic idea resonates deeply for me. His poisonous words are more a part of Andrew's psyche than legitimate coaching techniques. What grabs me about the film is its discussion on artistic perfection, and especially in these intimate and rough sequences of practicing. What is objectively great in art? When is it good enough, and why? It toes a fascinating line. That's why drumming is such an interesting choice for the film to explore because it's so instinctive. Drummers have to make decisions within a fraction of a second and talent can only take you so far. The roaring beat in Whiplash puts your heart in your throat. Teller's performance as Andrew is terrific, one to match Simmons.

Chazelle is committed on expressing the physicality of drumming and Teller captures it exhaustively without feeling contrived. It's the virtuosity of the writing that allows us into Andrew's head however. It's a long road to the top, but the script makes the right decision to allow him to revel in the little moments of success, but then to immediately test him in surprising and involving ways. Each turn of the story shapes his expectations and ambitions and then escalates it to the right point. While the film is a gripping experience nonetheless, in retrospect perhaps it is too bitingly cynical. It does suggest that you have to be deprived of a meaningful relationship to achieve your goals. It does appear to be very anti-positive reinforcement, but perhaps it's merely a statement on the abundant sheltering that the latest generation is enduring. Whiplash is refreshing to see, we all know we wouldn't be resilient enough to take that kind of punishment so it's cathartic to watch Andrew go through it all and see how far he'll go. His frustration, regrets, fear and rage with himself cuts to the core of the human condition as he's pushed further and further.

The technical aspects of the film help it become so stimulating with dizzying closeups tightly edited together and its the stark orange tinted cinematography. It's thoroughly impressive that the film was shot in only 19 days for them to get shots so immaculately timed and performed with all those complicated movements. There's a refreshing brevity to the film with its sharp atmosphere, but it's so rich in emotion, psychological tension and personal subtext. It neither rushes nor drags, on paper nor on screen. It really is a film that lingers in your mind for days, nagging you, like Fletcher over your shoulder. Maybe it'll continue to linger for weeks. I hope so too, especially for Oscar voters. It seems that J.K. Simmons is building momentum to be a lock for Best Supporting Actor at this point. However, Whiplash isn't just a best of year film, nor best of decade. It approaches best of all-time worthy with its identifiable themes of meticulous work ethics, fulfilling aspirations, resilience of the soul, and knowing when to no longer measure yourself to your mentor. I'll take this film with me for a while as a screaming motivator.

10/10. Best film of the decade.

12. Whiplash,10/10,"""I'm exhausted!""","I felt like I had a workout after watching this. Something that I think everyone thought after watching it.

It's intense. You'll tap your foot. You'll be happy and sad for Andrew. And when he's not making you laugh you'll be scared of Fletcher. And you'll never feel the runtime.

J. K. Simmons is one of my favorite actors. Whenever someone asks me why I tell them, ""Watch Spider-Man. Then, watch Whiplash.""

12. Whiplash,8/10,Just My Tempo,"Greetings again from the darkness. The pursuit of greatness is not always pretty. No matter if your dream is athletics, dancing, music or some other; you can be sure hard work and sacrifice will be part of your routine. You will likely have a mentor, teacher or coach whose job is to cultivate your skills while pushing you to new limits. This film questions whether the best approach is intimidation or society's current preferred method of nurturing.

Miles Teller plays Andrew, a first year student at an elite Manhattan music conservatory. Andrew dreams of being a great jazz drummer in the vein of Buddy Rich. When offered a rare shot at the top ensemble, Andrew quickly discovers the conductor is a breed unlike anything he has ever encountered. The best movie comparison I can offer for JK Simmons' portrayal of Terence Fletcher is R Lee Ermey's Drill Instructor in Full Metal Jacket. This is no Mr Holland's Opus. Fletcher bullies, intimidates, humiliates and uses every imaginable form of verbal abuse to push his musicians, and especially young Andrew, to reach for greater heights.

Andrew and Fletcher go head to head through the entire movie, with Fletcher's mental torment turning this into a psychological thriller ... albeit with tremendous music. We witness Andrew shut out all pieces of a personal life, and even take on some of Fletcher's less desirable traits. Andrew's diner break-up with his girlfriend (Melissa Benoist) is much shorter, but just as cold as the infamous opening scene in The Social Network. At a small dinner party, Andrew loses some of the sweetness he inherited from his dad (Paul Reiser), and unloads some Fletcherisms on some unsuspecting family friends.

Writer/Director Damien Chazelle has turned his Sundance award-winning short film into a fascinatingly brutal message movie that begs for discussion and debate. The open-ended approach is brilliant, though I found myself initially upset at the missing clean wrap that Hollywood so often provides. What price greatness? Is comeuppance a reward? Are mentors cruel to be kind? For the past few years, I have been proclaiming that Miles Teller (The Spectacular Now) is the next John Cusack. Perhaps that bar is too low. Teller just gets better with each film. His relentless energy draws us in, and we find ourselves in his corner ... even though this time, he's not the greatest guy himself. Still, as strong as Teller is, the film is owned by JK Simmons. Most think of him as the dad in Juno, or the ever-present insurance spokesman on TV, but he previously flashed his bad side as the white supremacist in ""Oz"". Even that, doesn't prepare us for Simmons' powerhouse performance ... just enough humanity to heighten his psychological torturing of musicians.

You should see this one for Simmons' performance. Or see it for the up and coming Teller. Enjoy the terrific music, especially Duke Ellington's ""Caravan"". See it for the talking points about teachers, society and personal greatness. See it for any or all these reasons - just don't tell director Damien Chazelle ""good job""."
12. Whiplash,9/10,Intense,"This movie was far better than the trailer made it look.

JK Simmons gave a stellar performance as a music teacher in the best Jazz school, trying desperately to find and develop the next jazz legend. From the moment he appears he demands the screen, literately. There's a part in the flick were he just burst open the door putting a halt on whatever is going, and makes it all about what he wants, which sets the tone for the entire movie. One of the best antagonist I've seen at the movies.

Miles Teller plays the protagonist, A first year Jazz student who wants to be the next Jazz legend and is willing to go through the pain needed to become just that. I've been a fan of Miles Teller for a while and this movie just increase my fandom

It does not matter whether you are into jazz or not, this flick is about and boy willing to kill himself to become the best and the man willing to kill the boy so he can be the best. For anyone who has ever been in that kind of pressure, weather it be at college or on the playing field(I kid you not, watching these guys play Jazz played out like I was watching a Football movie with Miles being the Quarterback and JK being the coach)

It was an emotion trill ride with a lot of ups and downs, and just when you think the ride is over, we go for a second time around.

Excellence!!"
12. Whiplash,10/10,A strive for perfection.,"Music teacher Terrence Fletcher spots something in raw, but talented young drummer Andy Niemann, desperate to get to the top, Andy makes several sacrifices, to strive for greatness.

I can't always give one hundred percent attention to a film, sometimes my mind can wander, here though, I was glued for the full run time. This film is absolutely phenomenal, a relatively low budget movie, but one with an incredible story and some phenomenal acting.

How can a film be equal parts subtle and brash, I can't explain why or how, but this film has an incredibly rich content, there is so much going on beneath the surface.

The characters, incredibly rich, rounded and thoroughly believable, I must start by commenting on Fletcher, he's fascinating, irascible, angry, but deep, smart, demanding and passionate. JK Simmons won an Oscar for this performance, and deservedly so, he is breathtaking here, it is acting to savour.

The film is as much about Fletcher, as it is about Niemann, a total contrast, where Fletcher is hard, brash and tough, Niemann is a little naive, meak, cute, but loaded with talent, it's Fletcher's outrageous demand for perfection from him that's the key.

Damien Chazelle nailed it here, the script is pretty near perfect, Oscar nominated, it should have won it.

I am blown away by this incredible film, 10/10."
12. Whiplash,9/10,Blistering,"Nominated for five Oscars, and winning three (editing, sound and Best Supporting Actor, with nominations for screenplay and Best picture), 'Whiplash' is positively blistering, with a darker and more realistic view on aspirations and done in a way that's tense and inspirational.

Visually, 'Whiplash' looks great with grittily atmospheric photography with plenty of beautiful, gripping shots (like close-ups of the drum playing) and some of the tightest, cleverest and most audacious editing of any film that year. The sound is also thrilling in its intense authenticity, and really add to the impact of the pulse-racing Jazz soundtrack. There is in particular unbelievable drum playing that serves as a fond reminder of iconic drum players of the classic Jazz Age, the final drum solo is long but exhilaratingly played and a huge part of why the ending sends up a storm as much as it does.

The script is sharp and cutting, sometimes uncompromising and at other points patient. The story is not new, but makes a point of aspirations and talent having its dark and less glamorous side, competitiveness and that there are always obstacles (including dictatorial bullies). While not quite as extreme in life as shown here situations and people like seen in the film exist. The story is at its most successful in its tension between Andrew and Fletcher, which is thrilling and nail-biting, and Andrew's very relatable and inspiring drive and passion, and much of it is very taut and rarely laborious in pace.

Damian Chazelle directs with a clear love for film and the jazz style and passion for the subject. 'Whiplash' has great performances all round. The secondary cast do much with little and Miles Teller more than holds his own in a telling lead performance. This is JK Simmons' film however, proving that his Oscar win was one of that year's most deserved wins. He doesn't just dominate the film with his ruthless manner as a terrifyingly dictatorial character, but actually IS essentially the film, one's terrified of him but also understands his point of view.

'Whiplash' could have been slightly better this said. Most of the supporting cast, especially Andrew's family (the film at least tries to say why the romance was rushed and dropped, in that it didn't mean anything to him like his playing of music did), are severely underwritten and underused. The car crash scene and the aftermath also feels out-of-kilter and even the most committed musician wouldn't be in the right function to do what happens after that scene.

Otherwise, this is a blisteringly great film with a huge amount to recommend. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
12. Whiplash,9/10,"Tension, tension, tension!","After seeing Damien Chazelle's Whiplash - a film the young up-and- coming director wished to do for some time now - being so beautifully realized and brought to life by everyone involved in the project, I was glad and relieved, mainly because I have seen the short film, which was pretty incredible.

I believe that among the most telling facts about a film's fortunes and qualities, is the ability to broaden it's public, but in the same time not forgetting that cinema is not all about commercial success and mass audiences.Or with other words - a film that is not just eye candy and booms and explosions, but also craft, soul, dedication and wits.

Those are some of the things not only the film itself possesses, but the people behind it have in abundance as well.

The upcoming Miles Teller plays the young and dedicated student Andrew Nieman, who has the drive, the ambition to succeed and to be great, which is fine, as long as it doesn't derail your personal life.A lesson the young drummer learns the hard way.

Blind ambition is the thing, that can describe our anti-hero of sorts, Terrence Fletcher a.k.a the brilliant J.K. Simmons, who has a thing for mindeffin' his students to the point of total physical and mental exhaustion and even depression.But he does it for a reason, for the sole purpose of finding the next big, even great, thing in jazz and in music as a whole.The next prodigy, the next ""Yardbird"" Charlie Parker that will be otherwise lost, if not being pushed to the very limit.

And boy, does J.K. Simmons nails it.Chazelle has done a masterful job in casting the two leads in Teller and Simmons.Their respective acts are full of purpose, full of tension and ultimately terrific.

Expect some awards going in the way of ""Whiplash"" and look out for Simmons in the Oscars shortlist, that's how good he is in it.And in his own words: ""What a shame we wrapped it up in only 19 days"".It must have been really fun playing a part like Terrence Fletcher and Simmons completely sold it.

As I said, the best movies are those, that reach out to the most diverse and wide spectrum of audiences, not those, who can connect to a massive number of people, who are representatives of only one specific audience type.And Chazelle has achieved just that with ""Whiplash"" - a precise, tension-building film, full of beautifully staged pieces and above all else, a love towards music and the challenges it often represents if you want to get to the very top.

The film ended in a big round of applause from the packed theater and I am sure that will be the case a long time from now!

My grade: 9/10"
12. Whiplash,9/10,A pair of outstanding performances by Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons embody Damien Chazelle's piece of perfection...,"When it comes to cinema, there are often little gems in a sea of bigger spectacles, that can break through in the most proficient way. Last year, I pleaded to the entire film universe that discover and understand ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" from the Coen Brothers after seeing it for the first time at NYFF. This year, I've seem to already come to terms that the next film that will utilize all my energy and resources this year will be Damien Chazelle's highly intense psychological drama ""Whiplash."" An impeccable and tightly wound experience that brings your anxiety to a feverish level. As small, and utterly different as I'm about to compare, I haven't felt this uneasy with a film's tension since Paul Greengrass' ""Captain Phillips,"" coincidentally also was a NYFF title. Two other similar traits that embody the two are the intense and completely submersible performances that inhabit them. Stars Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons are absolutely astonishing, featuring two of the year's very best turns.

Chazelle's film tells the story of Andrew (Teller), a first year music student that seeks out and joins the prestigious school band, headed by an intense and frightening teacher Mr. Fletcher (Simmons).

Walking out of the screening I fully knew (though I fully hope to be proved wrong this year) that Miles Teller would be my ""Oscar Isaac"" this year. A performance that should shoot to the top of any awards consideration for a lead actor, but unfortunately will be passed over show after show. Teller is submerged in a way that we haven't seen the young actor achieve at this stage in his career. After plowing onto the scene opposite Nicole Kidman in ""Rabbit Hole,"" and then helming ""The Spectacular Now"" with complete ease and intensity, I was not expecting him to be the machine of fury and magnitude that is on display in ""Whiplash."" There are moments where he channels the emotional aura of performances like Tom Hulce/F. Murray Abraham in ""Amadeus,"" as crazy as that sounds. I am so excited to see where Teller goes from here. It makes the future of film a lot more bright, knowing that someone like him will be rising up in the ranks.

Everything you've heard about J.K. Simmons is true and then some. A fully fleshed out supporting role, Chazelle doesn't write Fletcher as a caricature. He's a deeply acute individual, full of passion and acrimony. Chazelle doesn't keep Simmons at a ""10,"" he and Simmons allow him to find a range of empathy, hatred, and cryptic allowances that will keep you at the edge of your seat. As I watched Simmons flesh out a performance that can only be described as magnificent, I kept coming back in my mind to Christoph Waltz in the Oscar-winning ""Inglourious Basterds,"" a role that found much heat on the awards circuit. The world/all film lovers will not be able ignore the stunning presence of Simmons. A Supporting Actor nominations (maybe even a win) seems all but assured (and deserved). Looking back at the veteran actor's career that included memorable roles in ""Juno,"" ""Burn After Reading,"" and ""Up in the Air,"" a role like this could not have come at a better time. Already impressive in his brief work in Jason Reitman's ""Men, Women & Children,"" writers, directors, casting agents, and producers will be pounding on the actor's door.

You can't credit ""Whiplash"" without citing the words and control by writer/director Damien Chazelle. An amazing and outstanding sophomore effort (unfortunately have not seen his debut ""Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench"") that channels a young Bennett Miller. Vigorous, self-assured, and innovative, Chazelle is a brilliant auteur filmmaker that knows exactly what type of films he wants to make. He takes inspiration from his own life, his love of film and music, and other places I'm sure we don't know about, and molds them into a gritty, layered experience, conditioned with rich characters, all realized through the writer's story. It's one of the best scripts of the year.

""Whiplash"" features some of the best minutes of film seen in 2014. An ending that will bring tears to your eyes, dual performances that will have you applaud, and an experience that you surely will not forget. Drumming has never felt like such a personality. It acts as a visible tool for the viewer to understand and try. If you love music, appreciate education, and dare to be better than your current state, you will find something very real to latch onto. Hold on, and hold on tight.

""Whiplash"" is being distributed by Sony Pictures Classics and will be released October 10 in limited release (and then expanding after). A must-see for all movie lovers!"
12. Whiplash,10/10,Astonishing performance,"This is a very unique movie even u are not into jazz but still can drew u into the atmosphere of it without moving your eyes.My eyes were dry after seeing this movie.Miles and Jk portray it flawless .Jk remind me of ex employer will use your weakness background against you if anything go wrong.Director done very well using camera angle to capture the face of the actor to create the tension in it.Have to admit I hate Fletcher brutal teaching, but most of the music icons were pushing to their limit practice to perfectly everyday,so he is not entirely wrong also.just my fantasy,it will be great if this movie can use 120fps technology to capture the facial expressions of two lead actors.

12. Whiplash,9/10,A Portrait of the Artist as a Crazy Young Man,"I work with a guy who studied music in school and had friends who went the music conservatory route, and according to him ""Whiplash"" is authentic. To which I say...Oh my God! Because this film is a nightmare.

Miles Teller gives an under-appreciated performance as a drummer following his passion who is lucky enough (if lucky is the right word) to be chosen by a psycho jazz teacher (J.K. Simmons) to join his class. What follows is a battle of wills, as Simmons tries to grind his students to stumps of their former selves while Teller proves that he won't be so easily dominated.

""Whiplash"" goes in a very dark direction and completely defies expectations, which is what I liked most about it. I was expecting a kind of ""Devil Wears Prada"" set in a music school, where the eager pupil first wants to give up, then rises to the challenge, earns the respect of a tough teacher but ultimately decides his worth doesn't depend on proving himself to anybody. But that is most decidedly NOT the direction this film goes, instead turning into a contest to see how much crazier and more obsessed one maestro can be over another.

Simmons shouts and blusters his way through a one-note role. He's good in context of what he's asked to do, but it's the kind of showy performance that wins Oscars, not a subtle and complex characterization. Teller is the heart and soul of the film, and he's tremendous. The film is like watching a car accident in slow motion and being unable to do anything to prevent it, and just as unable to look away.

Winner of three Academy Awards (Supporting Actor for Simmons, Film Editing and Sound Mixing) and nominated for two others, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay.

Grade: A"
12. Whiplash,8/10,terrific performances,"Andrew Neimann (Miles Teller) is a first year student at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory. His father Jim (Paul Reiser) is a sweet high school teacher. He gets picked by Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) to be the backup drummer in his winning Studio band. He gets enough confidence to ask out Nicole (Melissa Benoist). Fletcher is a cruel manipulative dictatorial teacher.

J.K. Simmons gets a great juicy part to show his skills that he has shown all these years. He fully deserves his Oscar win and it's not a surprise. He's certainly done great work in many TV and movie roles before over the years. Miles Teller take a great step up. He has done good work but this is something much more. It's a compelling character who develops and changes. He's able to play through it all.

12. Whiplash,10/10,Wow just wow. Easily one of the greatest films of the year,"There is so many excellent great things to say about this film. To start off I will say it may be slow and to different for some to enjoy and so that I warn you. Now I will say that I can not express the idea enough of how surprising this film is. Jk Simmons does an outstanding performance as the highly unpredictable hair trigger tempered teacher Fletcher, Miles Teller an actor who I've only seen in mediocre comedies also shines in a breakthrough performance as the ambitious drummer Andrew. The performance are outstanding and that's just the tip of the iceberg.

My favorite thing about this film is how it has created it's own one of a kind spot in the music genre of film, it's atmosphere is unlike any other as well. The idea that this film is one of a kind can't be stressed enough, I guarantee you cannot find another film out there like this. This film expresses a shockingly high intensity for a music film. I believe that Jk Simmons acting is what fueled a lot of the intensity. When you watch this film even though it's pace will seem slow to most it's intensity is impossible to miss.

I can see how a lot of certain people may find this film hard to enjoy but for me this film as slow as it is couldn't have been more intense. The mere fact that a music film shows some strong intensity like this one did is mind blowing to me. I don't know how many of you had this same experience or something similar then you already know what I'm talking about. I have a good feeling and I'm hopeful this film rakes in some acting Oscars because this film deserves at least one. I haven't read anything on this films page and I'm sure others have expressed similar opinions and all I can say is listen and trust me. I'm praying you enjoy this film and experience it's one of a kind intensity just as I did. Thanks for reading my review and enjoy."
12. Whiplash,7/10,A Psychological Horror Story,"In New York, a young jazz drummer (Miles Teller) is enrolled in a prestigious music school. His ambitions are tested and manipulated by a sadistic, perfectionist music instructor (J.K. Simmons).

There are occasional moments in the film that seem far-fetched and over-the-top. But these are forgiven due to the edgy execution by director-writer Damien Chazelle and the acting.

Teller is very believable as someone whose obsession to succeed overrides his sense of safety. This is partly explained in a useful scene at the beginning of an extended family gathering where one-upmanship seemed to be the traditional form of communicating.

However, the movie belongs to Simmons who is the epitome of the authority-from-hell. He has rightly won many awards for this performance and he is likely to win more. He is so frightening when he is dominating the students that, even in the audience, there is a sigh of relief felt when he is acting more at-ease and human. His presence is that strong.

""Whiplash"" ably presents the question of whether attaining genius is worth the price - at least in certain circumstances. It also succeeds as a psychological horror movie. The Simmons character is likely to be mentioned in the future as one of the movies' most memorable villains. - dbamateurcritic"
12. Whiplash,8/10,The Conflict is Better than any Superhero Movie,"The story of a jazz drummer who is pushed to the brink by sadistic music conductor.

As a drummer myself, I found the depiction of the art, the the elements of 'the band room' very accurate - with the exception of the crazy conductor (mine was quite nice by contrast). What makes this film so excellent is the character driven storytelling. I watched this the same weekend as Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (""MOM""), and I was far more captivated by the conflict between the characters of Whiplash than I was of MOM.

Whiplash featured incredible twists and turns, that kept me glued to the screen. This is an underrated gem that deserves more praise.

12. Whiplash,10/10,An incredibly powerful film!,"http://switchingreels.com/2014/01/28/sundance-review-whiplash/

Ever had a dream of being a great football player? A great dancer? A great singer? A great musician? Our protagonist has a dream of being a great drummer, a drummer that will be remembered forever. Maybe you are still fighting for your dream. Maybe you have given up on greatness. Greatness doesn't come easily, you need to practice at it. Andrew practices until his hands bleed.

Andrew (Miles Teller) is 19-year old student at a music conservatory in Manhattan. Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) is a teacher at the conservatory with a ruthlessly brutal teaching style. After picking Andrew to play in the school band, he pushes Andrew to his limits in order to realize his full potential, at the risk of his humanity.

I had a billiards teacher at one point in my life, who was close to becoming a pro in his craft but a grease fire accident changed all that. His perspective changed, to paraphrase, he realized he was becoming an asshole. He became a teacher of pool instead of becoming a pro player. Through him, I can understand what Terrence Fletcher was trying to instill into Andrew. My teacher would push me a little bit. When he gave me opportunities to show him up, ""run the table now,"" he would tell me, I failed. It's embarrassing when that happens but it's also a learning tool because more work needs to be done. You can't get by on talent alone but it certainly helps. On the other side of it, I saw a little bit of my teacher in Andrew. Losing who you are to perfect something you love. Good thing my teacher realized before it was too late.

I lost myself in the story. It had something to say about not settling and asking more of yourself. Two fantastic performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. Perhaps it will push you to maybe pick up that guitar again, put on your ballet shoes, or hit the gym to bulk up. Whiplash is an incredibly powerful film. And after the final shot cuts to black, the film will stick with you for days.

My expectations: Medium. I did not expect the film to be so powerful for me. Expectations exceeded.

Recommendation: Cinema lovers and casual movie goers, I believe will enjoy this film.

Re-watch value: I can watch this film again and I actually can't wait until it hits distribution.

Memorable: I am still thinking about this film."
12. Whiplash,7/10,"Intense movie, phenomenal J.K. Simmons but unrealistic","This movie should please a wide audience of non-musicians. I am not a musician but I've seen movies based on things I know very well and it's always exaggerated and unrealistic and it usually bugs me more than other people; I can easily imagine how real musicians may dislike this one. The directing and acting are great (although J.K. Simmons steals the whole show) as are cinematography and sound. However the whole premise is wildly unrealistic, and the moral of the story ""to be great you need to be pushed beyond your limits"" is a tired trope that has often been done in a better way than here. On a personal note, I hate bullies with a passion and there can never be a ""but it's for a good reason"" excuse for bullying.

12. Whiplash,10/10,Beat a path to the cinema to see this,"Whiplash is simply astonishing.

Miles Teller plays Andrew, a gifted and highly ambitious drummer in his first year at an elite New York music academy. There his talents are spotted by Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), an equally ambitious coach and mentor who is always looking for the ""next big thing"" but has never found it. However, there is a very thin line between being an ""ambitious coach"" and a terrifying bully, and Fletcher constantly crosses that line sometimes inflicting a terrible impact on his young students.

In an almost uniformly male environment, love interest is served from the cinema concessionary stand by Nicole (the charming Melissa Benoist) who the shy and uncertain Andrew finally plucks up the courage to ask out on a high-point in his emotional roller-coaster. Spot the female, featuring Melissa Benoist The 'school for protégés' theme has perhaps been trodden before by movies like Alan Parker's ""Fame"", and some of the emotional and creative jostling of elite musicians has appeared in films such as 2012's ""A Late Quartet"". But none of these deliver the degree of passion and intensity metered out in Damien Chazelle's movie.

Miles Teller (""Divergent"") is superbly credible as the aspiring jazz drummer Andrew, and it is almost unbelievable that he was not a professional drummer-turned-actor for this film. In fact, the more accomplished jazz drummer (very different to rock drumming apparently) is Nate Lang who plays Carl, his key competitor for the ""percussion 1"" role. The two were apparently locked away in a drumming 'boot camp' for 2 months prior to the movie being filmed.

But the starring role in the film goes to J.K. Simmons, probably best known in the supporting role of J. Jonah Jameson, the cranky editor of the Daily Bugle in the Spiderman films (and a number of other Marvel spin-offs). Simmons is quite simply astonishing, channelling the sort of Oscar-winning performance of Louis Gossett Jnr (""An Officer and a Gentleman"") into his vicious drill-sergeant-style performance. He has been nominated in the Best Supporting Actor role for both Golden Globe and BAFTA awards, and I would fully expect him to feature in the Oscar shortlist when they are announced on January 15th. Personally speaking, he will be the one I will be cheering for in the awards themselves.

Cinematography by Sharone Meir is outstanding, with every drop of blood, sweat and tears glistening on forehead and cymbal. The editing by Tom Cross is also extremely tight, winding up the tension during key encounters. The combination of the two together with Chazelle's tight script effectively spears the audience in the gut.

The feature is based on Chazelle's short film of the same name, and on this basis he is a name to watch for the future.

Gut-wrenching and enthralling, this film will spit you out the other end feeling emotionally drained. This is simply a film you MUST see. Let me drum it into you again. GO SEE THIS FILM!

12. Whiplash,6/10,OK Social Drama - Whiplash,"So, you wanna be the best in the world at what you do? You have to go the extra mile and work like a dog until you become the master of your domain. (apologies to Seinfeld). Miles Teller is a young drummer who wants to be the next Gene Krupa or RIngo Starr. Good luck with that idea. J. K Simmons tells him, no problem; all you have to do is sacrifice yourself on the altar of unrelenting practice, practice, practice. Play until you bleed, baby. And that is all there is to it; much easier said than done, however. We see the trials and self-doubts of the young Andrew, and the fierce determination of Terrence Fletcher, as he tries to make a star out of Andrew, despite having been a never-was himself. Terrance lives out his fantasies by torturing Andrew, but in a constructive way. Entertaining.

13. Saving Private Ryan,10/10,Hard to Rate ... been there,"The first 23 minutes of this film is rated at a 12.

My good friend and I took our sons, 17 at the time, to see this in a theater. I am a senior military officer who experienced combat in 1967 - 68 - 69. We wanted the boys to see the horror of war, the slaughter.

I have had to pack up the personal effects of my comrade to send back to his mother after he was killed in the Viet Nam war. Those of you who have not done this cannot even comprehend.

After the opening combat scenes the film was an 8. Well done.

War is hell and to those of us who have been there ... well I don't know what to say.

Neither of our sons joined the military ... thank God."
13. Saving Private Ryan,10/10,The only movie my grandfather couldn't finish,"My grandfather fought in WW2 somehow surviving D-Day. He was apart of Operation Neptune and stormed the beaches of Normandy. He told us a lot of war stories but rarely ever spoke about that day. Before he passed away he did an interview with a local newspaper and detailed what he saw despite it being very difficult for him to speak about. He loved watching war movies... not sure exactly why. Some about that soldier life never really leaves them I guess. He absolutely hated Pearl Harbor cause of the horrible way they portray the military to be a bunch of toothbrush wielding babies who don't know what to do in the event of being attacked. He had a friend stationed there who lost his life and thinks that movie is a disgusting display of ignorance. Soldiers don't take girlfriends on private plane rides. And they most definitely know how to swim. Maybe I'll give that movie a good ripping one day.

But Saving Private Ryan was a respectable ""I can't watch this"" reaction. He said no movie has come that close to capturing what that day was like. He said it was too realistic. Whether or not the story is based on real or fiction, that intro was 100% realistic. I'm not sure if he ever did finish watching it but he appreciated it for capturing that chaos like no other movie has before. I watched the movie a dozen times now and keep it in my collection as a reminder of my grandfather. A scene he was technically in. Which makes me appreciate how strong of a person he really is.

War is hell and this movie not only shows that while being an entertaining experience but also captured what soldiers are left behind with. My grandfather was not afraid of anything. I've seen this man walk into a cellar full of black widows to get firewood and not even shake them off. The only time he ever experienced fear was when he went to bed. His nightmares of his time during the war would haunt him in his sleep. This movie helped me understand why."

13. Saving Private Ryan,8/10,"A strongly acted, powerful film that is unashamedly brutal!","This is definitely one of the more powerful war films out there, if not the most powerful. I will admit, when I first saw it at school, I found the first half-hour extremely upsetting to watch.

The acting is outstanding. Especially from Tom Hanks and Matt Damon, and the music alongside Schindler's List is John William's most haunting score I've heard.

It does drag in the middle and the dialogue doesn't always flow as well as it should, but what we have is a historically accurate, extremely well made and directed and unashamedly brutal film. I mean, in the stabbing scene, towards the end, my English teacher had to leave the room. It was like watching Frankenstein's monster tearing out Elizabeth's heart.

8.5/10 for a truly emotional and appropriately sombre war-film, that is a little slow at times. But it deserves to be in the top 250, really it is that good! Bethany Cox"
13. Saving Private Ryan,10/10,I Agree: This Is The Best War Movie Ever Made,"Without looking, I am sure other reviewers here have headlined their article ""Best War Movie Ever Made"""" and I agree. However, before briefly discussing the film, let me just say if you don't have a decent 5.1 surround sound system, you aren't going to fully appreciate this movie (DVD).

It's a great film to start with, and sitting in a room surrounded by five speakers with bullets flying from all directions around you - as in that spectacular 22- minute opening scene or in the final 45 minutes of action against the Germans in tanks - is an astounding movie experience. The sound in this film elevates it even higher.

The visuals are outstanding, too. I've never seen so many grays, beiges and olive-greens look this good: perfect colors for the bombed-out French city where the last hour takes place, perfect for the faces and uniforms of the gritty soldiers, for the machinery, the smoke-filled skies, etc.

My only complaint is the usage of Lord's name in vain 25-30 times, but, hey, when you consider it's tough men in tough times, that's what you are going to hear. In real life, the profanity probably was worse than the film.

It's hard to picture the brutality of war being any worse than you see here, but it probably was. This is about as graphic as it gets. The violence and gore was shocking when this film came out in 1997 and still is when watched almost a decade later. It's unbelievable what some of the WWII soldiers went through, but that can be said for any war. I believe the purpose of this film was to pay tribute to the sacrifices these men made, and it succeeds wonderfully. Hats off to Steven Spielberg and to Tom Hanks, the leading actor in here, both of whom have worked hard for WWII vets to get the recognition they deserve, not just on film but in a national memorial.

Anyway, language or blood and guts aside, this is still an incredible portrait of WWII. The almost-three hour film is riveting start-to-finish, especially with that memorable beginning action scene, probably the most dramatic in the history of film.

As ""entertaining"" as those action scenes were, I found the lulls, if you will, to be even better. Listening to Hanks and his men discuss various things as they look for Private Ryan, was fascinating to me. Hanks is just superb in here and once again shows why he is considered one of the best actors in his generation.

The most memorable and powerful moment among the ""lulls,"" is the shot early on of the Ryan mother sinking to her knees on her front porch as she realizes she is about to get disastrous news from the war. Moments later, Harve Presenell, playing Gen. MacArthur, eloquently reads a letter by Abraham Lincoln that is so beautifully written, so profound that it is quoted near the end of the film, too, and I never get tired of hearing it.

This is a man's movie, and shows the horrors of war as few others ever have. To say it is ""memorable,"" just doesn't do it justice. It is the greatest war movie ever made....period."
13. Saving Private Ryan,9/10,The most realistic harrowing battle scenes ever filmed...,"Steven Spielberg makes a unique motion picture in regards to the D-Day invasion of World War II just in the gritty reality of the detail For more than twenty minutes he revives for us the landing at Omaha beach No one was prepared for how horrific it really was No one understood what was going on: The terror, the chaos, the maelstrom of bullets, the near-deafening explosionsYou really got a sense of what these guys had to go through

Within that perplexity, the focus settles on six soldiers under the command of Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks) after they've survived their terrible hours breaking through the first line of German defense, they're given a strange perilous mission, to find one man, Pvt. Ryan (Matt Damon), a paratrooper who's somewhere behind German lines For them, it's an abstruse order, but they have to get it done

Throughout the film, Spielberg's attention to detail is amazing For me, the most chilling scene in the movie is the death of an American officer It's one of the most intimate It's also a slightly confusing moment because two German characters resemble each other so greatly

Toward the middle, a German soldier called ""Steamboat Willie"" is introduced By the end of the film, he has become the 'bad' German Later in the movie, another German is involved in the final fight He takes part in an exceedingly painful scene of hand-to-hand combat with the American soldier The two German soldiers have similar short haircuts and black uniforms Because they looked so much alike, many of us have believed that they're one character They're not, and the distinction of the two is very significant"
13. Saving Private Ryan,10/10,This should cool off the Rambo wannabes,"The opening beach assault sequences were the most violent, realistic, and upsetting filming I've ever seen; looked as though the thing was actual combat footage. The shushing noises of rounds cutting through the air was the most chilling part of all. Perfect portrayal of the insane stupidity of war and the anguish of all who enter this most foolish of enterprises. A must see.

13. Saving Private Ryan,10/10,One of the best war movies ever made,"I'm starting to think that everything that Speilberg touches turns to gold. This is probably considered one of the greatest movies of all time and it is directed by Speilberg. The movie is incredable. The beginning was horrifying. I couldn't believe how accurate it was and painful it was to watch. When I studied WW2 in high school, I thought no one could ever re-create the Beach of Normady. But Speilberg did. I felt like I was there with the soldiers. I felt their fear, pride, and love for their country. I couldn't believe how much dedication our armies put into fighting and winning the war. And whenever I go to visit Washington D.C., I have more American pride then ever. I am more than proud to give this movie a

13. Saving Private Ryan,8/10,Horrors of War,"There's violence and there's violence. With the huge numbers of personal reviews of this movie, I'm hard pressed to add much. The first half hour affected me like no other in recent years. I wondered as the boys threw up on the amphibious carriers whether they were seasick or scared beyond belief. When one uses the expression ""cannon fodder"" so casually, do we realize that this means the second wave makes it's way to the beach over the dead and dying bodies of the first wave, like ants sacrificing themselves to ford a puddle. The ones that get through, get through because there are only so many bullets and so many people. They are exposed, disoriented, helpless--they have no place to go but ahead. I will be haunted forever by the soldier searching, then finding his dismembered arm in the carnage. I will remember those trying to get above water, only to be cut down below the surface. If anyone has a heart, his or her attitude toward war should never be the same. How can we who have never been there have a hint of what it must have been like. Like Schindler's List on the Holocaust, this should be a training film on war."
13. Saving Private Ryan,9/10,Numbing experience of SPR redeems baby boomers...,"It's been over a year since first seeing Saving Private Ryan -- it's a worthy effort by Speilberg--his best since Shindler's List by far. You've probably heard about the amount of violence, blood, and gore and that's all true--it's got the Viet Nam movie style violence (and then some) but it's not gratuitous. Were it sanitized like early WWII movies, modern audiences probably wouldn't take it as seriously.

The movie has that trademark Speilberg style--the structure is all tied up and unified from beginning to end, the emotional symbols abound, the music swelling when he's working at your emotions, the hand held camera that worked so well in Shindler's List to give you a feeling of participation, camera angles and periods of silence to disorient you (like Shindler), suspense techniques learned from Hitch... It's a movie that stays with you for a period afterwards.

Hanks will be the early front runner for Oscar after this flick--Academy members like him AND it IS his best acting job ever. While Speilberg will likely be criticized for attempting to manipulate the audience's emotions while keeping a distance from the inner core of his characters, Tom Hanks reveals a really complex military leader in this story, and does so without overacting--somehow it comes from within. While you may not empathize deeply with many of the platoon, you will still feel something because of the relationship that is formed with Hanks.

After the initial set-up, you will have the opportunity to participate in the D-Day operation and experience the horror of it. Those who have been in a real war can comment about how realistic or not Speilberg captures its chaotic horror in this scene.

In my case I again feel very lucky that my draft number was high, so I never had to face Nam like many of my classmates. Speilberg reminds us brutally in ""Saving Private Ryan"" that we All have a debt to pay to the brave souls who have sacrificed so much for us. What Tom Hanks does with his performance is to remind us of this debt in a very personal way."
13. Saving Private Ryan,10/10,One of the most outstanding movies ever,"Saving Private Ryan is, without a doubt, the best war movie ever made and one of the best movies of all time. I wasn't sure what I would think of this movie before I saw it. I heard the gore and carnage was too much, and I heard the story and action was great.

When I finally did see it, I loved it. The gore wasn't as bad, in my opinion, as everyone said it was. I thought the battles scenes were fantastically done. They were entertaining to watch, but with a certain sadness to it. I also think the moments of reflection among the soldiers was very good too. You got to hear their thoughts about the enemy, the soldiers and the war itself.

The acting was great, especially by Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks certainly deserved the Academy Award for best actor, even though he did not get it. Matt Damon also did a great job as Private Ryan. Watch for a great cameo-like performance by Ted Danson.

The storyline was interesting. Most of all, it showed what the war was like and how horrible it was. Some of the American soldiers were killed before they even entered the battlefield, some before they could even fire back, and some went down in a blaze of glory. Either way, you felt pity for the Americans and hatred for the Nazis.

The mission the soldiers were on was to find a single man, Private Ryan, and bring him home, because all of his brothers were killed and he was the last male survivor of the family. You, along with the soldiers in the movie, will always be thinking about whether it is worth it to risk eight lives to save one man. Many things happen through the film that will keep changing your mind about it.

If blood, guts and gore bothers you, you really should not watch Saving Private Ryan. Otherwise, I recommend going out and buying it right away. You will not be disappointed."
13. Saving Private Ryan,10/10,Breathtaking,"I have never been affected by a movie the way Saving Private Ryan affected me. That movie really took me out of my seat in the movie theater and practically had me believing I was really in the battle with John Miller. When somebody was dying in that movie, it felt as if you could almost feel their pain. Speilberg did an unbelievable job of putting realism into this movie with the camera-work and everything else. Simply amazing. An all time great.

13. Saving Private Ryan,10/10,One of Spielberg's Most Haunting and Visually Stunning Films,
13. Saving Private Ryan,10/10,The Greatest War Movie Ever Made,"It gives a million reason why no one should go to war and one very powerful reason to go to war. It is a soul numbing realistic depiction of what our grandfathers, fathers, uncles, brothers and sons have faced in humanities darkest moments. Not just in WWII but in any war. No one can see this movies without being altered in some way. No one should miss it with the EXCEPTION of those war veterans that have already been there. The surround sound puts the audience in the middle of the battle.

Steven Spielberg has out done himself and effectively held up a mirror to civilization for events to which we should all be ashamed of, rather than appalled at the movie for its real life depictions. I suggest that this movie be made standard view for congress as well as the President each and every time the question of war comes up. This movie would not stop future wars but I would hope the objectives would be much more clearly defined. I say this as a US Marine.

13. Saving Private Ryan,10/10,One of the best war films ever made.,"This film is an absolute masterpiece. It shows that war isn't always glamorous. Steven Spielberg won a Best Directing Oscar for his work on this film and the film went on to win four others. It is gritty and bloody and it shows that wars aren't won by weapons but by soldiers. The cast shine as the group of soldiers tasked with finding Private Ryan. Along the way they encounter the harsh truth and real meaning of war. It boasts impressive battle sequences and the stylish cinematography makes the film truly beautiful. The opening beach sequence is possibly the greatest opening scenes in movies. Tom Hanks is spell binding as the commander who has no idea about the harsh truth of war. Overall a truly amazing film.

14. Gladiator,10/10,They said you were a giant. They said you can crush a man's skull with one hand.,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.

In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.

What we do in life echoes in eternity.

So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.

Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.

I didn't know man could build such things.

Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10"
14. Gladiator,10/10,One of the best films ever,
14. Gladiator,8/10,"As a matter of fact, Maximus, I AM entertained.","Gladiator is the best bread and circus. A moving and very entertaining action epic with Russel Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix at the top of their game.

I absolutely love Joaquin Phoenix in this movie. He's the kind of villain you love to hate. So pathetic and childish. So ruthless and creepy. Just right amount of cartoonish. I wanted to punch him in the face.

It can be corny and it drags a bit during the escape plan part of the plot, but it has enough emotion and brutal violence to keep the audience entertained, and that's what a good gladiator match should be.

14. Gladiator,10/10,Spellbinding.,"One of the best films of a generation, it's a bold claim, but Gladiator truly is that good. Every single element is perfect, the story is phenomenal, one to absorb you for the full running time. The visuals are incredible, an epic masterpiece for the eyes as well as the soul. The acting first rate, surely the aim of any film is to move you, this does just that and then some.

The best of Russell Crow are far as I'm concerned, he really does command the screen throughout, Joaquin Phoenix is just as good, it makes me so sad that this was the last film of the late great Oliver Reed, and of course he's awesome.

I must also comment on the incredible soundtrack, the sublime music of Has Zimmer coupled with the ancient, enchanting voice of Lisa Gerrard, the music is the same glorious standard as the film, Now we are free still gives me chills, and takes me back to the film.

One of my top ten films of all time, a masterpiece, 10/10."
14. Gladiator,8/10,"20 Years On, It Still Rewards And Grips","20 years on, the first DVD I bought is still a barnstorming, thrilling ride. There's so much to recommend this - Lisa Gerrard & Hans Zimmer's iconic score, the canny casting of Joaquin Phoenix as a foil for Crowe; the realisation that I quote this film in everyday conversation far more than I thought I did. If it should have won the Oscars is a moot point - this is another of Ridley Scott's superb worldbuilding - one of his primary film-making skills, giving us a Rome that feels recognisable yet still a break from the cliché's that had seeped in to popular culture before this. That the film's status was boosted by the DVD boom as it made its way to home release is undeniable, but this remains a film that thrills, absorbs and grips.

14. Gladiator,9/10,"Disturbing, but beautifully made and well acted, as well as jaw-dropping scenery!","Ridley Scott rarely disappoints with his films. All of them, including the unjustly-maligned Legend, are visually stunning and just show the director's artistic genius. Gladiator should be up there as one of the best films he's done, if not the best. Almost everything on screen is very graphic, making some scenes upsetting to watch, but the visuals are just outstanding. The music score by Hans Zimmer just adds to the drama that is already there in the script. which is well written and rather Shakespearean. The performances were brilliant, especially Joaquin Pheonix and Oliver Reed. Russell Crowe is wholly convincing in the title role, and Richard Harris and Connie Nielson are also excellent. The costumes are brilliant, as well as the sets. In conclusion, Gladiator is a near masterpiece, only marred by some upsetting scenes. 9/10 Bethany Cox.

14. Gladiator,8/10,A Throwback To The Epics Of The '60s,"An intense Roman epic, a la ""Ben-Hur"" or ""Spartacus,"" it was nice to see something like this made again. It had been since the 1960s that we had seen a 3-hour extravaganza like this.

Like Ben-Hur, this is a story of a successful man who loses everything thanks to an evil man, and then has to fight his way back up to seek revenge on that man and to obtain his freedom back. It's a tried-and-true formula. This movie doesn't go to excess on the violence as some of the other more recent epic films did, such as ""Braveheart"" or ""The Patriot.""

The acting is excellent, beginning with Russell Crowe, who has established himself as one of the best actors of today. Joaquin Phoenix also put himself ""on the map"" as an actor with his portrayal of the evil ""Commodus."" He's so annoying you want to slap that sucker, which means he's doing a good job acting. Kudos to the rest of the cast, too.

Too bad they don't make more of these type of films, as they did in the 1950s and 1960s."

One of the most perfect movies ever made. The pacing, the characterization & development. Hans Zimmer's score. John Mathieson's cinematography. Career-making acting from Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, & Djimon Hounsou. Everything is on point.

This movie is an integral part of Ridley Scott's holy trinity, along with Blade Runner & Alien. Endlessly rewatchable. Endlessly quotable. An epic tragedy on the level of Shakespeare & Ancient Greece.

This movie will be just as popular a hundred years from now, and no movie about Ancient Rome will have topped it.

14. Gladiator,10/10,Edge of Your Seat Fun!,"Great Story! Great Writing! Great Acting! Great Directing! Great Score! This movie has it all. I especially enjoyed the mood of the film. Even though it has a lot of action, there is a subtle elegance throughout the picture that gives it great style. The movie flows effortlessly from scene to scene, while at the same time creating wonderful intensity and nail-biting excitement.

The acting in the movie more than lives up to expectations. Russell Crowe is brilliant in his role as Maximus, the ""general who became a slave, who became a gladiator, who defied an emperor."" Crowe's intense style is perfect for the relentless determination and confidence of Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix is equally wonderful in his role as Commodus, the corrupt emperor. He plays a great villain because he is able to give Commodus depth by showing certain vulnerable or fragile sides, while at the same time instantly transforming to let the ruthless nature of his volatile character shine. It also helps that Joaquin has the classic Caesar look that works perfectly with his role.

Connie Nielsen is also very good as Lucilla. However, perhaps the two finest performances in the movie were given by a couple of acting veterans in supporting roles. Richard Harris and Oliver Reed were exceptional in what will be remembered as crowning achievements at the end of their careers. Harris was perfect as Marcus Aurelius, the aging Caesar who reflects upon his life and contemplates how the world will remember him. And Reed, especially, gave my personal favorite performance in the movie as Proximo, the trainer for the gladiators. The way he spoke about the life of a gladiator, the splendor of Rome, and the ""thrill of the Coliseum"" really added excitement and anticipation during the viewing of the movie.

Gladiator is filled with many memorable moments that one would need to see more than once to fully appreciate. The excitement felt for me when Rome is first shown in all its wonder and marvel is my favorite scene. But the whole movie is a rush! Hans Zimmer provides the absolute perfect score to capture the different moods in the movie. Ridley Scott sets the perfect tone with his artistic and creative directing. I would recommend it to anyone who can stomach intensity and enjoy an epic story for the ages. Next to Braveheart, this movie is the greatest of all-time!"

14. Gladiator,10/10,The most perfect movie ever made,
14. Gladiator,10/10,A general who became a slave. A slave who became a gladiator. A gladiator who defied an emperor.,
14. Gladiator,10/10,Can't be missed!,"""Gladiator"" definitely is a classic film as it combines a simple, but moving, story with beautiful scenery, filming, direction and score  it is truly a ""complete"" movie.

I am mostly compelled with the beautiful script which in a way reminds me of poetry, though it is still everyday language. I love the acting portrayed by the late Oliver Reed and also Richard Harris. Russell Crowe, Djimon Housou and Joaquin Phoenix are also superb and the parts suit them perfectly. There are also a number of less ""popular"" artists who also deserve a big ""bravo"". Amongst them I have to mention ex-Mr Universe Ralph Moeller who is mostly used as the comic relief of the movie. In Gladiator we can also the beautiful and popular Maltese TV Star and actress Ruth Frendo, who although has a small part, she is totally brilliant and outstanding.

Actually I got to IMDb while I was looking for her name on the internet, in fact on IMDb she has some very stunning photos. I was lucky to meet Ruth Frendo whilst she was filming in another Maltese production. Ruth Frendo is not only a gorgeous and talented actress but she is also amazingly intelligent and very down-to-earth. We will definitely be seeing more of her work in the future...

The scenery used for ""Gladiator"" is brilliant  and the opening battle scene is definitely one of my top favorite scenes. The modern camera technique contrasts sharply to the brutality of the gladiators actions and blood shed during the movie; and I love the light contrasts thanks to the lenses which most definitely have been used to create a surreal feel to the entire movie.

""Gladiator"" deserves all the awards and great reviews it has received, and for those of you who still haven't gone and watched it  I can assure you that it will be well worth your time and money. So go on and rent it now!"
14. Gladiator,7/10,A Very Good Movie That Could Have Been Even Better,
14. Gladiator,10/10,Breathtaking!,"Once again, Director Ridley Scott proves to be as professional as one can be. The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid, with all its magnificent buildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness the greatness of the Roman Empire, with its political problems and military discipline, and love and treason, of hate and jealousy, that still have a place in our world today. But the story has a glow of its own, to which all the beautiful scenery (believe me, it's awesome!!!) and great cinematography are just balancing factors. The plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as it is present. He once again, after Blade Runner, 1492, and others helps us visit the depths of the human soul, which remains the same over all our historical and social experience. Even the fights, are displayed in such a way that all the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel like screaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out the performances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and actresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move the audience among screams and tears. All in all, we have guys like Russel Crowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promising harvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world. Well, you should see for yourself!"
15. Inception,10/10,A one-of-a-kind mind-blowing masterpiece!,
15. Inception,10/10,Is it possible the makers understand how incredible this film is?,"You only get to watch this for the first time once, so choose your state of mind carefully. It is a film about movies and dreams and reality, and what sort of life it is best to find when you leave the cinema and return to whatever you left to enter. It is spectacular, and brutal, and enigmatic and disturbing. It is beautiful and absorbing. It is about one of my favourite characters ever to grace the screen. I don't see it often, in case it's not as good as I like to remember it. That is my secret, that I lock away in my safe in the basement. That somewhere there is a perfect world for us all. For some, perhaps it is in the cinema watching this.

15. Inception,10/10,Inception was only less shocking to me than the Matrix,"When you wake up from a good dream, you feel the reality is harsh. When you wake up after a bad dream, you will be sentimentally attached to the beauty of reality. But as long as life is good, reality and dreams don't matter.

15. Inception,10/10,Answering all the questions with one answer: I feel guilt. ⭐,"When I first watch this movie, I was just shocked with it's twist. I'm not gonna mention details, because can't share any spoilers.

Simply this movie makes a complex story, that makes you question so many things. ""Why he is keeping her in his dreams?"" or whatever your question is answering with some well written line. That scene is the key to the whole movie. That line between Cobb and Mal answers all your questions at once.

That's why I like this movie so much. Some movies has that potential. Making a complex story that someone could answer with only one sentence. You're waiting for that line for whole content. But most of the contents (I mean movie or TV Series) are not managing that well.

Besides the greatness of the storyline this movie has a really great cast. So Acting Performances are also great. Award Winning Cinematography by Wally Pfister was too great. Original Scores by Hans Zimmer was brilliant. Visual Effects are unique. So not only the Screenplay but nearly all the technical details are great."
15. Inception,10/10,Generation defining.,"The 20th Century had Casablanca, Star Wars, the Godfather, Blade Runner, and others - this is the first of the 21st Century masterpieces. Truly in awe at how amazing this movie is, an astounding show of all aspects of films. Amazing story and cinematography accompanied with actors worthy of telling the tale. Remarkable and breathtaking.

15. Inception,10/10,My number one favorite movie,"Inception is my number one favorite movie off my twelve years on earth! It's absolutely impossible to explain the incredible that Inception has. Inception is Sooooooooo dang exciting, edge of seat, mind blower, and I wish there were more movies like it and more Christopher Nolans out there. Congratulations to the well deserved best director, writer, and producer of films (in my opinion). Also the acting is fabulous, everyone did an amazing job, and Leonardo was fabulous at explaining the dream concept. Also the CGI and effects are amazing. Go watch Inception because it is incredibly amazing in every aspect, and is my number one film of my twelve years on earth. Bravo to the Inception crew and wow at this fabulous movie!

15. Inception,10/10,Insanely Brilliant ! Nolan has outdone himself !!,
15. Inception,9/10,Mindcraft...,"There are those who seek to dive into your mind, take your secrets and whatever else they find, espionage, conspiracy, infiltration, skulduggery, through worlds that are all conjured, well designed. They've been asked to plant a seed, start an idea, change the course of an industrialists career, but it needs dreams within deep dreams, an architect to build the schemes, and the consequences, could be quite severe.

Imaginative beyond words, elegantly crafted and constructed, presented and performed by legends of the screen with a great storyline that keeps the viewer constantly engaged and on the edge of their seat - what more do you want out of movies.

15. Inception,8/10,Amazingly original...but also a bit overwhelming.,
15. Inception,8/10,Sci-fi perfection. A truly mesmerizing film.,"I'm nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn't follow up to ""The Dark Knight"", he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can't help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.

Not since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar to the excellent anime film ""Paprika"" in the whole ""invading dreams"" plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level.

Visuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time, it's either all-visuals-no-smarts (""G.I. Joe"", ""Transformers"") or the exact opposite (""Doubt"", ""Invictus""). In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability.

Although having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio (Warner Bros), this film is a very personal film for Nolan, he wrote the film as well as directing it, and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolan's perplexing, increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher, rather it is a film for thinkers. Honestly I can't explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed, confused and ultimately breathless. It's like a puzzle, both physically and mentally, and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the film's humanity, and this is where ""Inception"" shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come. That's right, years.

Once the film ends, you'll want to watch it again, for there's something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the film's ambiguous themes, and will be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film, no adaptation, no sequel/prequel, no remake/reboot, which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows (""Avatar"" be damned).

Of course, a film is not complete without the actors. Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance, similar but better than his previous effort ""Shutter Island"". He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can't seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.

Nolan is of course, a master behind the camera, a real virtuoso when it comes to film. His direction is taut, focused, gripping, and extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan, considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into pop-culture art two years ago (""The Dark Knight""). The action sequences are unique, exciting and fresh, something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The visual effects are awesome and imaginative, and best of all they do not bring down the movie's quality one bit, rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely, beautifully shot, so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory. Production design is top notch, with terrific design of sets and locations. Hans Zimmer's complementing music score is simply outstanding, and knowing the man, that's really all I have to say. Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this year.

Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted filmmaker, arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And ""Inception"" can proudly stand alongside ""Blade Runner"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" as science-fiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogether.

There are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people.

Missing this film and not getting the film's point is a crime.

Overall value: 9/10 (Excellent)"
15. Inception,10/10,Didn't win Best Picture? WHAT?,
15. Inception,9/10,This is your first lesson in shared dreaming. Stay calm.,
15. Inception,9/10,Matrix but in dreamworld? Nah.,
15. Inception,10/10,Incredible-Nolan keeps improving and Inception is by far the best improvement!,"I saw Memento very recently, something that turned out to be a great miss.I saw it again, just to make a couple of thins straight-and i'll definitely do the same with Inception.

Christopher Nolan keeps improving himself, with even more complex and multilayer script like this.And i thought Memento was hard to reach by most of the viewers, but no.Inception will keep you mesmerized and captivated by the genius, that's hidden behind it.And not just directors and screenwriters (or with other words-Nolan), but with acting and sound-and effects and editing as well.

When you have a cast like this-i mean Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Michael Caine, or Marion Cotillard (a personal favourite), the movie just keeps going flawlessly.Most of the crew is the same the Nolan brothers worked with on TDK and earlier in Batman Begins.So the Oscar noms in those categories are a certainty for me.

The only thing one could have against the movie, is the headache one could have.See, most of my friends go to the movies for brainless action, they enjoyed Iron Man 2 and The A-Team, but this movie-you have to see it at least twice, to understand it.The levels and the layers on which thing are happening are so many, that one surely'll miss something vital.This is a reason for not fitting to the mass audience, but i hope that won't happen, because Nolan is one of my favourite directors/writers, and he showed, that the brainless action flicks aren't all of it.There are still movies like Inception out there and still people like the Nolans to make those movies, so it's not all lost.And i hope this movie could show the audience that the story is still important for the experience one could receive, not the endless, constant explosions.Because this is really a one of a lifetime event.

Saying that, i must say, that in a world full of remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels and God knows what, this is a unique chance to see something different and unmatched so far-a strong movie, that, surely will be Nolan's latest masterpiece! My Grade won't change-it's the same for all Nolan movies-sheer 10!"
15. Inception,10/10,Nolan at his most intelligent best.,"Inception is truly one of a kind. A concept which has long gestated in Christopher Nolan's mind, his eye for drama mixed with his large scale sensibilities ring true in Blockbuster season making Inception a true original in the sea of reboots, remakes and sequels.

To try and explain Inceptions many plot twists and incredibly intelligent arcs, would be a foolish task. As Nolan himself has been reluctant to. The best way to approach the film would be with an open mind, if you are prepared to be taken on a ride of a lifetime, then trust that you 100% will. If Avatar was a seminal film in technology (although coming out as a rather poor film, in my opinion), then Inception is seminal in it's storytelling. With a 148 minute running time, you would expect a lot to take place, but what you wouldn't expect is the pace of it all. I did not think at one time in the film about how long was left. I was simply blown away by the depth in every single part of the film. If my enthusiasm for the storytelling aspect of the film has left you worried about the spectacle, then don't worry. They are, as hinted in the trailer, incredible, looking real and unbelievable simultaneously. The most pleasing thing about the action set pieces, is that they are genuinely used to illustrate the story, rather than to blow stuff up a la Michael Bay.

With this complex movie in it's high concept, a stellar cast is needed. And Nolan as always, delivers with just that. This is vintage DiCaprio, perhaps only equalled in The Aviator, which is even more impressive as his role as Cobb in Inception is not a showy one, needing DiCaprio to be the constant at the centre of the film. And he pulls off Cobb's emotional contradictions sublimely. The rest of the cast members all shine in parts of the films, Cillian Murphy shows off his usually non-existent tender side, Gordon-Levitt bottles his usual charm for his confidently reserved turn as the reliable Arthur, Watanabe is devilish as the seemingly ambiguous Saito, Page shows why she's the next big female star and Tom Hardy revels in being the comic relief of the film compared to his recent turns as decidedly psychopathic characters.

Overall, Nolan has indeed surpassed himself. He has created a world as expansive as his Gotham, a plot dwarfing the intricacies of Memento and one which blows The Prestige's cinematic reveal out of the water. This is truly unmissable cinema. Revel in it, we've still got to wait a whole two years before Batman 3."
15. Inception,10/10,The perfect summer blockbuster?,
15. Inception,4/10,"Thick and Unnecessarily ""Complicated""","Style over Substance might be a Knee-Jerk Negative Reaction to this Messy Film. But that would be Kind. There is no Style or Substance to Waste many Brain-Cells Considering. The Movie's Conceit is to make You want to Think. Think Not.

It tries so Very Hard with its Explanations about Dreams (don't do a drinking game taking a shot every time the word dream is mentioned, you will be dead by intermission). Also Wordy, Incomprehensible Insertions about the Teams ""Method"" used here to Infiltrate and Control the Minds of Corporate Clients (now there is a group we can morally support).

This is so Unnecessarily Complicated that it causes Viewer Fatigue, and by Proximation Sleepiness, early on and Waking Up or Recovering from that is not a Given. The Result is just not Caring about Anyone or Anything that is happening on the Screen. What is happening is kind of Drab and Dull for a Dreamscape.

If you buy the Premise and go along for the Ride, better fasten your Seat-Belts because it is anything but Smooth. It Bumps and Jumps from Dream to Dream and Layer upon Layer of Intellectual Gobbledygook that is so Very Uninteresting and Without much Pathos. The Music is forever in Swelling Mode and Ripples throughout and is Pretentious and Intrusive.

In the End, some have trouble making it that far, there is a ""you decide"" Twist that is not really a Twist because, after all, You Decide. But it is hardly Worth it and when all is Said and Done, too much has been Said and not enough has been Done. Vastly Overrated."
15. Inception,6/10,All right.....,
15. Inception,9/10,"A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Buñuel meets Kubrick in Nolan's most ambitious venture, till date","Surrealism can appear to be ineffably bizarre, or inquisitively titillating, depending purely on the viewer's intellect. Though the realm of surrealism is highly nebulous and complex, but even a slight attempt at improvisation can sometimes go awry and open a Pandora's Box, making the task highly improbable and nigh impossible. This facet of reality may pose a handicap to the most gifted of the directors, but not to the genius of Christopher Nolan, who not only dabbles with the concept of surrealism, but also ingeniously blends it with the elements of Science Fiction in his latest wonder named Inception. Nolan created a niche for himself a decade back by unleashing a monster of a movie called Memento. He further substantiated his status by conjuring movies like Insomnia, The Prestige, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. His unremitting desire for innovation and uncanny craving to foray into the unexplored realms of imagination deservedly earned him an auteur tag, which gave him the carte blanche that a story-teller like Nolan desperately needs. It's highly apparent that Nolan takes every possible advantage of this liberty while filming Inception. Inception is not only dreamlike, but is a dream in itself and is superior to any other thing conceived on the silver screen. With its entwined layers, the movie for the most part serves as an unfathomable riddle and makes multiple viewing extremely essential. It incredibly does extremely well on both the humanistic as well as the technical fronts. In fact, the balance between human emotions and the elements of Science Fiction is so adequate that it's impossible to separate them.

The movie is about a futuristic world where the human mind can be intercepted through dream invasion. Cobb is an expert in the art of extracting information (stealing valuable secrets) from deep within the subconscious in the dream state. His proficiency in extraction is marred by a turmoil that begins with his wife's untimely death. He is forced to live the life of a fugitive away from his children. His only chance for redemption lies with a Japanese tycoon named Saitu, who wants him to do an inception (planting information into someone's mind). In order to accomplish this unprecedented task, Cobb and his team must overcome a labyrinth of unforeseeable challenges, where even a slight miss could trap them in a perpetual limbo. Any further revelation would be remissness on my part as the plot is filled with such intricacies that even expatiation would be incapable of justifying its profundity.

Leonardo Dicaprio gives a solid performance in the lead role, following his memorable performance in Shutter Island. He has brilliantly depicted the complexities and limitations of Cobb's enigmatic character highlighting his pain and mental trauma. Marion Cotillard is ravishingly scintillating as Cobb's whimsical wife, Mal. The rest of the cast has given a thorough performance with special mention of Ken Watanabe, Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

Inception is incredibly brilliant as a movie and is a breakthrough in contemporary cinema. Nolan's creativity and his unparalleled execution definitely make it an object of great cachet, but whether it would become Buñuel's 'Un chien andalou' or Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' and serve as a prototype for the movies to come is for the time to decide. Irrespectively, Inception is sine qua non not only for an aficionado, but also for the average viewer, who is willing to delve deep enough to savour the delight.

PS: One has to imagine it to believe it. 9/10

15. Inception,10/10,Inception; Christopher Nolan's masterpiece?,
15. Inception,10/10,Come Back Again!,"If one goes to an art gallery to see a provocative piece, one sees something new each time. That's what true art is. That's why a black light Elvis is not art. This film is certainly a tour de force. It requires engagement at every step. LIke most works of art, it doesn't give it all away. I look forward to seeing this the second or even third time. First of all, the premise is wonderfully engaging. Our consciousness is layered as everyone knows who thinks they have awakened, only to find themselves in another nightmare--then they awaken again. We know that the subconscious by nature is out of our control. There you have a wonderful premise. Now layer that further with people who can flip in and out and use this to their own ends. While confusing, it's exciting. The amazing thing is that the director/writer pulls it off. Every nuance and event is picked precisely for its effectiveness. We have the luxury of watching from one precipice into the abyss. We do care about the people and not just because we want them to succeed. We care about the matrix of the dream levels. Great movie.

15. Inception,4/10,So much less intelligent than it seems,"Ten years ago, Christopher Nolan wrote and directed the brilliant 'Momento', a stunning thriller that pushed the boundaries of storytelling convention. It was great, but still, one couldn't help wondering, where would Nolan go from here? How could he trump this achievement? In fact, although his subsequent films have been praised, they've been less distinctive, but with 'Inception', he returns to his adventurous roots, producing a story that is even more audacious than 'Momento'; and unfortunately, the result is dreadful. And worse than the fact that it doesn't really work is the fact that while it is distinctive, it is distinctive in a very conventional way. Since his early success, Nolan has taken work from big studios, and 'Inception' is no exception; and the result is a Hollywood movie straining desperately to stand out, instead of something more truly independent. in spirit.

To make the point in more detail, 'Inception' features a starry cast (I'm, afraid for me, the casting of Leonardo diCaprio has become a clear sign of a poor film with pretensions); an implausibly attractive geeky female assistant; loads of expository dialogue (at one point, it is explained that someone is the most powerful media baron in the world – i.e. they appear to be so powerful that no-one had heard of them); fast pace and Jason Bourne style camera work; sub-'Matrix' style ideas about the nature of reality, superficially intriguing and certainly confusing, but of little philosophical depth; extraordinary special effects; and above all else, a plot comprising an incoherent sequence of random set-piece scenes that seems constructed to showcase said special effects rather than because it makes sense as a story. It may sound like an intriguing idea to have the cast simultaneously fighting for their lives in seven different nested dream-spaces, but in fact, it isn't; multiplying the threat to the heroes only reduces the dramatic impact of each one.

To give Nolan credit, he has made a wholly cinematic film; you certainly couldn't imagine this in book form. Sadly it's very hard to imagine it as a screenplay either, or as any sort of story. And it was story, not special effects, that made 'Momento' great; and while that story was highly unusual, it made internal sense. But less is never more in Hollywood; and sadly, more is often just a mess."

He has won just about every award for his performance in this film, and he deserves every single one of them. Take my Challenge: Watch this film and see if you don't get the chills whenever Christoph Waltz's character is 'interrogating' his suspects! Ooooo! He is ULTRA polite with each one; and has supreme confidence in his scary, chilling, bold mannerisms. All I can say is: ""You see this movie for Christoph Waltz's performance; all the rest is secondary""!

16. Inglourious Basterds,8/10,Quentin Tarantino's style and Christoph Waltz's menace,"In 1941 Nazi-occupied France, ""The Jew Hunter"" SS Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) finds the Dreyfus family hidden by their neighbors. Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent) escapes after her family is massacred. Meanwhile Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) has gathered 8 Jewish American soldiers to kill Nazis behind enemy lines. Their brutal scalping campaign instills fear among the Germans. Donowitz (Eli Roth) is even given a nickname ""The Bear Jew"" for brutally beating Nazis with a baseball bat. Then in June 1944, Shosanna has a new name and a theater. She catches the eye of German war hero Fredrick Zoller who wants a big premiere in her theater that will attract the biggest of Nazi leaders. It even attracts the Jew Hunter as well as the Inglourious Basterds.

Christoph Waltz is great as the cold menacing well-mannered Nazi. He is completely engrossing in every one of his scenes. Every word he speaks is dripping with menace. His scenes are quiet and some of the most compelling parts of the movie. Then Quentin Tarantino has injected his brutal violence into this Jewish revenge fantasy. It is nothing less than audacious and uniquely original."
16. Inglourious Basterds,9/10,Oh! What a Lovely War...,"There's a hunter called Hans Landa you should fear, if circumcision defines the way your men appear, on the surface quite polite, underneath riven with spite, carries a scar that lets you know of his career (or at least he will). But those un-helmeted can rejoice and be spurred, avenging evil come Inglorious Basterds, being led by Aldo Raine, with a remit to cause pain, several parts may disappear as things are sheared.

Great dialogue, great direction, sublime performances and original in its depiction of a war picture that's been repainted a thousand times before, but seldom with such entertainment - Tarantino's best in my opinion.

16. Inglourious Basterds,9/10,Glorious indeed!,"Aside from the Kill Bill's I have not seen any other Tarantino film. I heard this one was good and so I watched. It's great. From the opening scene you are mesmerized by Christoph Waltz's unnerving performance. He gets a lot of credit and rightfully so. Hans Lands is possibly one of the greatest movie villains of all time. There so many iconic moments and Tarantino demonstrates how normal dialogue scenes can become suddenly intense with words alone. Every actor gives it their all with Brad Pitt giving a memorable performance as well. This movie is worth watching just for its opening but it also has back to back quality scenes that are well shot and have excellent dialogue. The movie balances it's comedy with excellent dark moments reminding viewers that this is indeed a WW2 film. Overall, my favourite Tarantino film of the three I've seen and might be for some time. Worth watching for Christoph Waltz.

16. Inglourious Basterds,10/10,I can't believe I just now watched this for the first time.,"This is a perfect Tarantino movie. It's explosive and exciting while also deep and well thought out. It took me a minute to get used to reading so many subtitles because of the variety of languages used, but I think that's a quality that makes the movie even more enticing. It is incredibly well done and it had a hold of me from beginning to end. Fair warning for any Tarantino movie, be prepared for the gore and violence. It runs rampant throughout the movie, but it's kind of gratifying seeing it happen to the Nazis.

16. Inglourious Basterds,10/10,Who the hell is Christoph Waltz?,"That's what I thought, when I heard about the cast of Inglorious Basterds. And I'm both from Germany and into movies.

That guy is older than 50 and so far he almost only played in mediocre TV series - and even there he didn't play the main parts. Obviously nobody ever noticed, what he's capable of. Now, thanks to QT, he got one shot to change that - and - let's put it this way - that was a bingo! He is the living proof of what a great caster Tarrantino is.

By the way: I think it's a great privilege to watch the movie as a German - being able to understand everything. And the German dialog is written almost as good as the English.

Now I could repeat, what many others have written here before. I'll put it short: Finally, QT is back.

16. Inglourious Basterds,10/10,My Favorite Tarantino Film,
16. Inglourious Basterds,8/10,World War II In an Alternate Universe,"I take exception to the comment that one reviewer made saying that a film like Inglourious Basterds had not been made before. Not only was one made, but it was made during World War II. When Hitler, Dead Or Alive was shown I'm sure the same rousing cheers went up from the audience who really wanted World War II to end that way.

Quentin Tarantino must have seen Hitler, Dead Or Alive and decided to do a big budget version of that B film propaganda flick from the Forties. In that one Ward Bond, Paul Fix,and Warren Hymer play three German speaking gangsters who take a contract out on Adolph Hitler from some public spirited citizen. They enlist in the army, but as soon as they can they desert grab a plane with a pilot and land in Germany and set about to perform their task.

What Tarantino has given us is Hitler, Dead Or Alive with official sanction. Brad Pitt heads a group of GIs, the rest of them are Jewish so they'll have proper motivation for this job, Pitt's a good old boy from Tennessee. The purpose of their mission is to just kill Nazis, the higher up, the better. And they soon get a reputation that's come to the attention of the Fuehrer himself.

This film is a throwback to those propaganda films that came out as morale boosters during World War II. Pitt and the rest of the cast look like they're having a great old time with this. Best performance is Christoph Waltz who plays an SS colonel who specialized in tracking down Jews who've escaped Hitler's final solution. He might just get an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

As for the end, just relax and imagine this is World War II in an alternate Universe."
16. Inglourious Basterds,8/10,"Not for everyone...but if you like this sort of thing, watch it--it is a lot of fun.",
16. Inglourious Basterds,8/10,"Great fun, a real surprise","It just goes to show how wrong you can be. I had not expected to like this film. I was disappointed by both the Kill Bill films (although i preferred the second) and Death Proof (although it was better in the shorter cut of the double-bill release). I love Reservoir Dogs, admire Pulp Fiction and think that Jackie Brown is Tarantino's most mature piece of film-making - technically his most superior - including the last great performance elicited from Robert De Niro. Since then it seems to me while his films have been okay (i haven't hated them) he has been treading water in referential, reverential, self-indulgent juvenilia.

Then i read the script last year for Inglourious Basterds - and i hated it! Sure it had some typical QT flourishes and the opening scene was undeniably powerful. There were a couple of great characters. But on page it was more juvenile rubbish, largely ruined by the largess of the uninteresting Basterds of the title. It made me seriously contemplate not seeing the film. The trailers did nothing to convince me. I only changed by mind when i had the opportunity to see the film with a Tarantino Q&A following in London. I figured it would be worth enduring to hear him in Q&A as i know from interviews how entertaining he can be in person.

So little was i prepared for the sheer exuberant fun and brilliance of Inglourious Basterds.

Easily Mr Tarantino's best work since Jackie Brown it is a triumph.

Yes the references are there but they do not interfere with the story, they are not the driving force. Yes Eli Roth is stunt casting but he works fine, with little to do but look aggressive, and does nothing to hurt the film as i had feared. While i admired Mr Tarantino for using stuntwoman Zoe Bell as herself in Death Proof in order to amp-up the exhilaration of the major stunt scene her lack of any acting ability in a key role was a problem for the film. The same could be said of Tarantino's own appearances in several films, especially Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn, which Tarantino wrote.

What really makes this work is how BIG it is. The spaghetti western vibe to much of the style, dialogue and performances is wonderfully over the top without descending too far into the cartoon quality of Kill Bill. The violence is so big. The audacity so big. Brad Pitt is so big! In the trailers the Hitler moment and Pitt's performance bothered me but in the context of the film they are hilarious. Pitt is actually brilliant here, exactly what he needs to be. He is Mifune's blustering samurai in Yojimbo, he is Robards Cheyenne from Once Upon a Time in the West, there is a very James Coburn vibe to him, and of course a suitably Lee Marvin edge.

Christoph Waltz (who i did not previously known) and Melanie Laurent (who i first noticed in a brilliant French-language British short film by Sean Ellis) are sensational and i expect to see both used a lot more in the future. Tarantino has clearly not lost his eye for casting, which seemed to desert him in Death Proof. Waltz is equally large in his performance. Chilling, yet theatrical. He is Fonda from OUATITW, Van Cleef from Good, The Bad & the Ugly. And Laurent is suitably Cardinale innocence but tough, a fighter. They both dazzle here.

That every member of the cast gets the fun to be had from what they are doing while not indulging themselves in just having fun and trying to get laughs helps tremendously. The laughs - and there are loads - come organically. Only Mike Myers comes close to tipping the wink and pushing it too far but his scene is reigned in just enough - with the help of a fantastic Michael Fassbender who seems pulled directly from the mold of Attenborough's Great Escape leader.

All the actors shine and Tarantino throws in wonderful flourishes, but ones that work with the story. The introduction of Schweiger's Hugo Stiglitz is a riot. After a sensational slow-burn opening and a glorious intro to those inglourious Basterds the pace never lets up and over two and half hours flies by.

It also looks beautiful, marking this as a return to real film-making rather than just self-indulgent silliness. The musical choices, as always, are inspired from Morricone on.

The film is audacious and hilarious. After a summer when nearly every film has disappointed me it came as a huge surprise that the real fun and entertaining, but also involving and impressive film should be this one, when i would never have believed it from script form. Welcome back QT."
16. Inglourious Basterds,3/10,Schlock and Awe.,
16. Inglourious Basterds,10/10,No Matter How You Spell It,"...""Inglorious"" as our local theater decided to display its title on their marquee, minus the second word. It is terrific cinema.

I don't hesitate to recommend this film to all but the over-squeamish. Let them never know what they're missing.

I did hesitate to give it ten stars because of my experience of Tarantino's previous films. In every case, save ""Reservoir Dogs,"" they have improved with additional watching.

So although I gave it ten stars, I did so reluctantly. It leaves me no ""up"" to go to.

Yes Christoph Waltz is the Nazi we've all imagined the worst to be. He is cultured, sophisticated, suave and most sadistic, the kind of man who can make a glass of milk a threat and who puts out his cigarette abruptly in a strudel, grinding it into the whipped cream as if he were grinding his heel into a victim.

To understand Tarantino's films, you need only have a sense of dialogue, color and pacing. The colors are as bright as necessary and when necessary, brighter yet. In the French farmhouse of the opening scene, they are muted and dark, but excessively so. Outside a brilliant sun is shining, but in the one room of the house, everything is bathed in shadows and black.

It is a brilliant setting for an interrogation by Waltz, as the ""Jew Hunter"" of the SS, who dangles his host French farmer over the precipice of revealing what he cannot reveal numerous times, then pulls him back with obsequious lines of friendship and understanding.

A second sadistic German, well-played by August Diehl, later functions as important actor in the final plot twist. Diehl's Nazi Major, who has an ear for German accents, is almost as good as Waltz....almost.

Film classes will study much from this movie. They should look lovingly at the superb pacing. Tarantino knows just how long to draw out a scene, building suspense in the manner of Hitchcock, then at just the breaking point, suddenly coming to a resolution.

For color, look for a final shot at a French Theater, where its secretly Jewish proprietor is staging a surprise for the upper reaches of Nazi leadership.

We see her, played by Melanie Laurent, awaiting the hated German dignataries who will arrive for a film preview of the latest Deutsch film masterpiece, a propaganda piece about a German hero and his dubious accomplishments.

Laurent is framed on a balcony, reflected in the glass mirrors of the gorgeous theater, her red lips and low cut dress reflecting everywhere the intensity of her designs on her guests. It is a single shot that would be worth an entire film.

There are thankfully many more such images, many more paced scenes of exquisite dialog and suspense.

In short, see it. I'm sure you'll see it again and again."
16. Inglourious Basterds,10/10,Tarantino's Pride,"Wow! Every single time I watch this movie I am completely engaged and excited by it.

The acting is incredible and Hans Landa is one of the best characters ever written in film history.

The story is captivating with twists that make the film impossible to look away from.

The feel of the movie is so immersive that without the sometimes comical arrows and signs, I sometimes forget I'm even watching a movie and not in the moment with the characters.

This is the pinnacle of film making in my opinion and the silly, dark, and comedic moments of the film make it an absolute masterpiece.

16. Inglourious Basterds,1/10,A revisionist Holocaust fantasy of far-fetched proportions!,
16. Inglourious Basterds,9/10,A Comedy Of Horrors,"Brad Pitt sticks his index finger in Diane Kruger's leg wound and keeps it there until he gets what he wants. Funny, horribly so. The invented yarn takes ""The Dirty Dozen"" for a ride and sometimes abandons it to pay tribute to other movies. Lots of fun. Even ""Paris when it sizzles"" is mentioned in a delightfully organic piece of dialog. I was thrilled by Christoph Waltzer's character and by his sensational performance. Brad Pitt creates a true original. I love the actor's lack of vanity. There's a quirk in the character that is pure Brad Pitt. Tarantino visits a new universe but. fortunately, his hand. his brain and his heart are visible all over the place.

16. Inglourious Basterds,1/10,Fiasco,
16. Inglourious Basterds,4/10,Hitler's Table Talk,"One good thing about waiting several years after a very well received film is released is that you can step back from it and judge it on its content without all the hype . Sometimes if you go against the grain you do feel you're in danger of being branded a blasphemous heretic who should be locked up in order to keep little children safe at night or worse still to protect film makers from unpopular views . To be honest I have real excuse for missing Tarantino's INGLOURIOUS except that it never popped up in front of my radar until now . After finally getting round to seeing the movie I can put my hand on my heart and say I didn't miss all that much

It's interesting that so many professional critics agreed that the best thing about the film was Christoph Waltz performance * and that this was qualified by the critics saying stuff along the lines of "" I found my interest waning when Waltz wasn't on screen "" . This sums up the entire problem with the movie - the scenes go on for far too long and lack a brevity of storytelling .A character sits down at a table and talks . And talks . And talks . There's a saying that jaw jaw is better than war war . Noble sentiments indeed and one hopes in an alternative universe that Tarantino is the British prime minister while Tony Blair is a cocky Hollywood movie brat but for a film lasting almost three hours there's little incident and actually feels longer than three hours

Two selling points might have been that it's a war film and that it's a post modernist film . In other words it's a film that should make intelligent fun of all those terrible B movies featuring criminals in uniform who have the choice of a hangman's noose and volunteering for a suicide mission but there's not a lot of fun to be had here . One had hoped for constant knowing cheeky winks to the audience but this doesn't happen . There's certainly very little action to the movie and most of the film is composed of characters sitting down and talking in German or French or English . Just because a film contains subtitles doesn't make it worthy and you're left feeling there's no way this film would have been produced if it wasn't for the name of Tarantino . Little of importance happens in the narrative except to illustrate the film's own underserved self importance

* Strangely enough when DJANGO UNCHAINED was released the critics once again praised Waltz as being the best thing about the movie . This is obviously critics code for "" Wait for this movie to appear on television because it's overlong , arrogantly self indulgent and often boring """
16. Inglourious Basterds,4/10,A dangerous and irresponsible film from a director who used to be great...,
16. Inglourious Basterds,7/10,Pretty good,"This movie is a bit overrated and really isn't the best of Tarantino, but its still a good film. Very great acting and cast of characters, amazing cinematogaphy. A entertaining but stupid and unrealistic story of WW2. Good effects and just very well done, good film but overated.

16. Inglourious Basterds,9/10,Waltz with Pitt,"C. Waltz is the new discovery in this movie. He might have had a following in German speaking countries, but with this movie, he's getting world famous. Speaking 4 languages (and that's only in this movie, who knows how many more he is able to master) and being the main actor in this, despite the title of the movie. Which leads us to one thing that might be appalling to some people (especially to those who love(d) the original ""Inglorious Bastards"").

The thing is that the ""Basterds"" (and yes the spelling mistake was intentional by Mr. Tarantino) do not get that much screen time. It's almost as if their story isn't the main act. You could have a problem with that (not only as a fan as stated above), so be aware that this is more an ensemble picture. And as said, Mr. Waltz is fantastic (I'm pretty sure we're gonna see more of him soon). Brad Pitt would be the second one to mention. Eli Roth on the other hand, as fun as it is to see him on the big screen, he just doesn't fit the bill. Til Schweiger and the other German and European actors are all really good. I'd say that some give the performance of their life.

Speaking of the actors, one of the things that I really loved, is the fact that the movie is at least tri-lingual (is that a word?), french/German/English (with a bit of Italian thrown in there for good measure). That means a lot of subtitles if you watch the original version. But it works (imo) and makes the movie that much better.

Another thing that you shouldn't expect though, is too much action. I heard quite a few people that criticized the movie, for being too talky. But that's Tarantino for you. There is action of course, but the long running time (might be a bummer for some) is made up by many conversations. There is tension, there is fun to be had, but the movie does take it's time to reach it's goal. Again, something that won't work for everybody. Great movie that cements Tarantinos status as great director."
16. Inglourious Basterds,8/10,"Hey, It's Tarantino!","I've read so many of the naysayers. Giving this a one rating seems really spiteful. They speak of Walz's excellence in his role. If there is an actor of such incredible skill, how can one give it one star. Yes this is violent. Yes it is gratuitous. Yes it stretches the bound of reality. But Tarantino pushes the envelope at every turn in every movie. My God, what about ""Django Unchained."" There will always be flying body parts and characters of almost supernatural proportions. The plot that leads to the face-off in the movie theater is very intricate and does stretch our believability meter, but it is really engaging. Yes, the Germans are interesting in their own ways. Remember, this is not a propaganda film. We are put into a setting that is not for one instance a real portrayal of an historical event. But it does draw out the evils of war and makes a serious statement. It does have heroes and heroines. I know at times I was left a bit confused as to the point, but it didn't diminish my enjoyment of the movie itself.

17. Raiders of the Lost Ark,10/10,There will never be another film like Raiders,"It is a hot sunny day in South America. We see a bunch of men, shot mostly from the back. They are walking deep into the forest. We see a tall dark figure. He is wearing an old leather jacket, he has the 5 o'clock shadow looking like it's closer to midnight, he wears a fedora and he carries a bull-whip ( yes a bull-whip ). Finally, two of the men enter a cave and we hear about some guy named Forstall, who was good, very, very good, but he never came out of the place alive. But they enter anyway. They are confronted with tarantulas, spears that are triggered by blocking out the light, a pit that they must swing over and then more tiny poisonous darts that come out of the wall. All this to protect an ancient gold statue. They recover it. One guy dies and the other barely makes it out of the room before it all falls on him. Then he has to get out of the cave and a giant boulder chases him. Finally he makes it out of the cave only to be surrounded by Hovitos and his arch enemy named Belloq. He takes the gold statue that this guy worked so hard for and then the guy runs and makes it to the plane where he is in the passenger seat and there is big snake in the plane. He hates snakes. This mans name? Indiana Jones!

Whhhoooooo!! I'm left breathless just describing that opening. But is there a better beginning of a movie ever? Absolutely not. Does the beginning have anything to do with the rest of the film. No. It is all decoration for what the movie is going to put you through in the 90 minutes to come.

Indiana Jones is the best character to ever hit the screens. And he better be. He is created by George, Steven and played by Harrison Ford. That may seem normal now that we have lived with him for 20 years, but can you imagine what that must have been like back in 1981. That would be like Tom Hanks or Will Smith joining forces with James Cameron and Steven Spielberg for a completely original idea in today's terms.

Raiders took a simple idea and maybe an idea that the guys had from watching Saturday afternoon movies and made it larger than life. This film never stops for you to take your breath. It is filled with rich characters from Indy himself to Marion to Belloq and even to Marcus Brody. Each has their own personality that shines through in certain scenes. Some of my faves were when we first meet Marion having a shot contest in her bar in Nepal. Then there is her scene with Belloq and they get drunk together and she tries to leave using only a butter knife. And of course who can forget Indy's battle with the swordsman and his unrivaled determination to get the ark. "" Indy, there is not time. If you still want the truck it is being loaded on a truck for Cairo. "" ( a battered and bloody Indy ) "" Truck? What truck?"" ( and then later ) ""Get some transport back to England, boat, plane, anything. Meet me at Omar's. I'm going after that truck. ""

Sola ) "" How? "" ( Indy ) I don't know I'm making this up as I go.""

Raiders has more energy than three action films. And that is what makes it the classic that it is. If you like movies, then Raiders is a movie that will not let you down. It is pure entertainment and that is indisputable. It finds the youngster in all of us and bombards us with this silly, whip-cracking, average, incredibly determined archaeologist and only asks us to have fun. And that we do. And to me, the only reason that Chariots of Fire won best picture that year is because it is a serious film. Raiders was heads and shoulders above Chariots and it should have cleaned up at the Oscars in 81. But more politics with the academy.

Raiders of the Lost Ark is the epitome of entertainment. What more can be said about it. If you haven't seen this movie in a while or if you haven't seen it at all ( gasp ) then do yourself a favour and rent it tonight. It is awesome.

TRUST ME"
17. Raiders of the Lost Ark,10/10,Classic and timeless action adventure,"Archaeologist-Adventurer Indiana Jones hunts for the ancient Ark of the Covenant.

This movie is a spectacular introduction to one of the most iconic action heroes of twentieth century cinema. It has one of the greatest opening sequences of all time and follows it up with a plethora of classic cinematic moments.

We have a McGuffin based plot moving through a variety of locations, encountering a rival archaeologist and hordes of Nazis hell bent on eliminating Indy and taking the Ark for themselves.

Harrison Ford is a mixture of Bond and Bogart with his expressive face and rugged charm, while Karen Allen makes a combative and confrontational leading lady. ""You b*****ds! I'll get you for this"" Marion shouts at an entire platoon of Nazis. The two display excellent screen chemistry. One great aspect is the change in attitude we see from Indy towards Marion as the film progresses. Initially it's all about the Ark but by the end it's a bit more about her. Perhaps this is what saves him from the same fate as the film's antagonists.

Visually it has the feel of classics like Casablanca, Citizen Kane and Yojimbo. Spielberg has also borrowed and updated action sequences from the likes of Zorro and Stagecoach to great effect. Particularly impressive are the use of shadows in several sequences, my favourite being when the Ark is first carried out of its burial site. All of it is edited so that the noisey excitement is complimented by quieter moments that are just as memorable.

Spielberg's anger towards the Nazis rises to the surface in one of the film's themes covering good and evil. Images like the burning swastika and the wrath of god witnessed at the film's conclusion are examples of the Ark punishing those who have broken the covenant held within.

John Williams gave the film one of his finest scores and it makes every frame that bit more special. Seeing Indy swinging from jungle vines, chasing a truck on horseback and swimming on to a German U-boat would not be the same without that famous tune to give it that air superhuman confidence.

This launched a franchise for Lucas and Spielberg but it was never bettered or even equalled by any of the adventures that followed."
17. Raiders of the Lost Ark,9/10,Perpetually Entertaining...,"An army of fascists seek to plunder, an artefact so precious it's a wonder, an archaeologist will resist, using whips and guns and fist, in a treasure of a film packed with adventure.

There are puzzles to be solved and riddles broken, the dialogue's a joy, beautifully spoken, action packed from start to end, returns a massive dividend, engaging all the way and thought provoking.

17. Raiders of the Lost Ark,9/10,When Harrison Ford was crapping gold,"This is the first movie in the Indiana Jones series. It is also the best film in the series. Indy is hired by the US government to track down the sacred arc of the covenant. While he is on his quest the Nazis are also searching for the arc. This is a wonderful adventure story that covers many countries. Harrison Ford was born to play this role, and he does it with flair. After having seen this film quite a few times, you also get to pick out the Easter eggs that are scattered around. One hint is be on the lookout for two well known Star Wars droids. I do not think that there was a better combination in the 80's than Lucas and Spielberg. This in everything you would want from an adventure movie and more.

17. Raiders of the Lost Ark,10/10,One of the best action movies ever made.,"There is no denying, that this film will forever be one of the greatest movies in the action/adventure genre. Ahead of watching the newest Indie movie, I decided to go straight back to the first one, it's been some time since I last saw it, but it is as still fresh, exciting and downright fun as I remember.

The plot is pretty wild, to reach the prized artefact, Indie has to battle through all manner of dangers, battling Nazis in the process, it sounds outlandish and outrageous, but it works.

I'd still regard it as Harrison Ford's defining role, he is a huge character, Indie is a real free spirit, he's funny, daring, charming and captivating, the eternal adventurer, perhaps the reason he's back forty years on.

Raiders of The Lost Ark is the first of the Indiana Jones, and arguably the best, although I also love Temple of Doom.

The perfect film for a bank holiday evening, or teatime on boxing day, it's an adventure that has something for the whole family.

Expect some amazing action sequences, this has some impressive fight sequences, explosions, chases, it really is a visual feast, I'm so glad it was made before cinema was captured by The CGI wizards (not that I'm taking away from what those guys do,) but the action feels real.

Four decades on, and it's still an exciting, action packed thrill ride, but then you know that already.

10/10."
17. Raiders of the Lost Ark,9/10,Will stand the test of time forever.,"I've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark numerous times on TV, DVD and big screen. My local theatre had a special showing last night and the 400-seat screen completely sold out (as Indy films always do). Luckily for me and my pal, we got the last 2 tickets available! I can't think of many films that still sell-out 25 years after their original release. There's just something about Indy movies(iconic hero, affection, epic spectacle) that brings you back again and again.

The only trouble with that is there are zillions of reviews, critiques and dissections of this movie already out there, so what I have to offer will probably not be anything new. I will however not go the way of the cliché and mention 1930's serials, Tom Selleck or the sword/gun fight.

I will, however, ask you one question. Did you know that some of the more iconic, memorable sequences from Raiders owe quite a lot to Duck Tales? What? Surely it's the other way around? Well, no. The globe-trotting adventures of Scrooge McDuck, Huey, Duey, Luey and Donald in Carl Bank's Disney comic-books from the 50s came first. If you can find some of these then you'll surely notice the similarities.

The hunt for the Ark of the Covenant is more than just an excuse for action. So many movies these days seem to come up with action first and string them together with some lame plot. Movies like this are quickly forgotten and one of the reasons Raiders holds up so well is because it works the Covenant story so well into the plot.

The action comes in a succession of set-pieces. I do enjoy films that have to increasingly better themselves in every scene. Raiders introduced this as a standard that the sequels had to live up to. My fave scene has to be the massive truck chase through Egypt, which is made up of many of its own smaller sequences. One little idiosyncrasy I like about Indy is that even though he's a College Professor and Doctor, he has no beef killing people. So very far from the ubiquitous PC heroes of todays movies.

You might think that it's rather geeky to hype up the editing and sound design, but they do stand out from recent action movies. The gunfire and punching seem to have a sort of 'Indy' signature sound to them, that I've not heard in any other films. And obviously, John William's classic score is one of those themes that just everybody in the world knows (though I prefer his score to Temple of Doom), truly one of the best movie themes ever. Better than Star Wars!

I'm not sure if Spielberg planned on Raiders starting the Indy franchise but there's already enough in here to establish a whole universe of potential stories and character arcs. There's talk of a fourth movie at the moment, but I personally don't think it will happen and I don't want it to. It's perfect existing as a trilogy and a sequel that comes traipsing in 18 years after the last is just not going to feel right. Even if you are hungry for more Indy then there are loads of books and video games out there and then there's the Young Indiana Jones TV show (where are the DVDs?), which are official Indy canon and even starred Ford once (they bounced around in time).

I am giving Raiders 9/10 because I just have a soft spot for Temple of Doom (which is obviously a 10/10 movie). Even 25 years after it first came out it still has the power to captivate the audience and provoke sheer excitement every time. And in 25 years it will still be far superior to almost everything.

Now there's something you cannot say about The Fast and the Furious! Sigh, where did all the special movies go?"
17. Raiders of the Lost Ark,10/10,Excellent movie and brilliantly crafted entertainment with a superb casting,"I remember seeing this movie when I was young, and it may well have been in the cinema with my Father, I can't quite remember (if he does, then please post the answer), anyway I do remember seeing it and being thoroughly entertained and that feeling of excitement and total fun staying with me to this very day as that is the feeling that the movie conjures up whenever I think of it.

I think a part of that is down to the fact it's a complete retake on the old serial movies combined with obvious comic book style, and that is just perfect for kids and appeals to them no end, or rather it did then! So it was with excitement that I opened my presents on my birthday and found the boxset for the Indiana Jones Trilogy, and with even more excitement when I finally watched the first in the trilogy, Raiders of the lost Ark.

It was just as I remembered, fun, excitement, wise cracks, a tiny splattering of romance but with a manliness that kids would allow, and lots of stunts and action. It's a superb movie and captures that style of serials, adventure stories and comic books perfectly, how I know that for sure is only through repeats since I wasn't alive during those times.

The set pieces are fantastic, and although some of the wilder end sequences are slightly dated now, it hasn't lost the excitement factor. It's a perfectly crafted movie as well, moving from location to location without any distraction or superfluous scenes, it just feels like it's all there for a reason and that it belongs there.

Harrison Ford is excellent in the role, and I'm inclined to think he was more Indy than he was Solo, but that's a personal opinion. He has many more facial movements and voice inclinations in this early movie than he does nowadays, now he belongs to the moody, quiet school of acting, then he was dynamic, adventurous, strong and as wisecracking as the best of them.

There are some excellent movie making moments in this with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg showing talent galore just oozing out of every pore (where did all that go for Star Wars I to III Mr Lucas?), and they end up making an excellently entertaining movie.

Some could argue that there could be a bit more depth or seriousness to the story, but come on, it's a ripping adventure yarn, you don't need depth. Saving the Ark from the Nazi's, surely that's enough! An excellent movie and great fun too, without a doubt one of my favourite of all time."
17. Raiders of the Lost Ark,9/10,"Harrison Ford, in the role that suited him best...","Ford stars as Indiana Jones, an archaeologist adventurer, who spends his time traveling all over the world through jungles, deserts, oceans, and caverns in search for hidden treasureslike the priceless long-lost Ark of the Covenant (the Hebrew sacred artifact that held the supposed Ten Commandments). Unfortunately, a group of treasure-hungry Nazis wants it too, having heard that any army who wins it would receive supernatural powers

With his trademark hat, whip, leather jacket, and pistol for backup, our stubborn, intelligent, determined and loyal hero escapes innumerable dangers, evades multiple obstacles including fearsome thugs in a busy Cairo bazaar, and hangs underneath a fast-moving truck in an exciting chase through a road These are only some of the film's incredible set pieces Steven Spielberg likable hero is not invincible, though, facing impossible odds, capable of getting beaten, struck violently, heart broken, and falling asleep after the first kiss

The villainsespecially Indy's suave and cultured French rival wearing a Panama hat and white suits, Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman)are not really that much different from him, except in their motivation The shrill heroine, Marion (Karen Allen)is not the girl always in discomfort either, but a resourceful, dynamic and formidable woman who doesn't require the hero at all

""Raiders of the Lost Arc"" is a perfect package of unforgettable scenes, countless action, humor, astonishing technical effects, thrilling sequences, and terrific performances It was followed by three fun sequels"
17. Raiders of the Lost Ark,10/10,Great great great Movie!,
17. Raiders of the Lost Ark,10/10,My favorite movie of all time!,"There are few movies I can watch over and over again, but this is one of them. This movie has it all: action, romance, comedy, and suspense. Harrison Ford is at his best as Dr. Jones, one of the most exciting archeologist ever. From the start to the end you are hooked to this movie. I love the opening when he as to dodge traps as he tries to get this treasure, I love it when he is running through the streets trying to save the girl, I just love every bit of it. Spielburg said he wanted a b-type movie like he remembered from his youth, but this far surpasses any b movie and any a movie as far as I am concerned.

17. Raiders of the Lost Ark,10/10,"To me, this will always be the best of the Indianna Jones series","For me it is not only the best of the series but one of the greatest adventure films ever made. It is breathless excitement from start to finish, and to be honest I cannot fault it really. The production values are wonderfully evocative, and John Williams's score is outstanding. The script is filled with wit and invention, and the story is slickly paced and exciting. The action is spine-tingling, with booby-trapped caves, snake chambers, Nazi spies, religious demons, damsels in distress and romance, and the special effects are dazzling especially in the superb climax. The direction is effortless, and there is little to complain about the acting either. The part of the unorthodox archaeologist fits Harrison Ford like a glove and Paul Freeman brilliantly plays a smooth villain. Karen Allen, Denholm Elliot and John Rhys-Davies are excellent as well. In conclusion, brilliant and if you haven't seen it do. 10/10 Bethany Cox

17. Raiders of the Lost Ark,10/10,An adventure classic that launched a legend,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is an adventure classic. Harrison Ford is fantastic as the whip-bearing, hat-wearing hero, Indiana Jones, and the story is full of entertaining twists and turns. This has long been a favorite film of mine, and I am happy that I was able to pass the legacy along to my children-who were only mildly traumatized by the face-melting scene.

17. Raiders of the Lost Ark,8/10,One of the great films of Spielberg's career and one of the greatest adventure films of all time,"It was born from the minds of some of the leading filmmakers of the moment, but an adventure that would become one of the leading film franchises. George Lucas had just created and launched two sci-fi classics with the first two chapters of the ""Star Wars"" saga while Spielberg was also already considered one of the most promising directors in Hollywood having effect astonishing successes with ""Jaws (1975)"" and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) "".

Classic recipe for matinees adored by George Lucas, the work of screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan is one of the most consistent doing an excellent job of keeping to the basics: virtually all characters in The Raiders of the Lost Ark are based on archetypes, but none of them lack personality. Indy himself is one of the most famous characters in American cinema, fitting the profile of the classic action hero, but with several peculiarities that make him special, from his acid sense of humor, his clumsy way to achieve a goal and also his intelligence. All villains are purposefully shallow and Manichean, with Nazism incorporating all the evil on Earth in a cartoonish way, but that never sounds strange in this proposal.

In ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", Spielberg makes his first openly action movie, even though ""Duel"", ""Jaws"" and ""1941"" had their setpieces there, here is a popcorn adventure from start to finish, and this is a category in which the filmmaker would become an expert. The opening scene alone is a lesson in how to introduce a character and his universe, with Spielberg's camera keeping a mystery about Indy's identity - Douglas Slocombe's photograph skillfully covers Ford's face with shadows - but building your personality and your iconic figure through frames that portray your courage and demonstrate your skills; see the closed planes of the hat, the leather jacket and the whip on the long belt before the protagonist draws it against an attacker. It is an aesthetic care and well elaborated by the filmmaker's camera game, which is maintained throughout the film's other numerous action sequences. Between shootings in bars, races to stop a truck and a fist fight on an airstrip, what most charm the project is the ability of the filmmaker to create an atmosphere of tension that embarks on a frantic and good-natured adventure. is one of the great strengths of the feature, guaranteeing the film never to lose its rhythm, while the characters go over obstacle after obstacle, as in a real board game. Spielberg's ability to command the action is present in the most ""naive"" scenes, such as the snake pit or the fight in the Nazi plane, even in the most elaborate ones, such as the chase of trucks involving Jones and several soldiers.

Classic backstage story, it was Harrison Ford's suggestion that Indy, when faced by a skilled swordsman in the Cairo market, simply shoot his opponent instead of starting an elaborate fight with his whip - as the script originally said. A sensational improvisation that came out of the mere fact that Ford and several members of the team were sick because of the heat and the local food, and that perfectly ended up defining one of Indy's personality traits. Throughout two other action scenes, the hero ""asks"" an opponent to wait while he prepares to return to the fight, and casually answers one of his colleagues who asks him what his plan is: ""I don't know, I invent on the way"". Priceless phrases and actions, and that only Harrison Ford would be able to deliver with such charisma and naturalness, in what is definitely the most striking role of his remarkable career. Ford is loose, unlike what he commonly complained of Han Solo here he can show some more facets and not a predominant one as is the extremely obvious scoundrel antihero. He is incredulous that the journey he will take will result in something really in the encounter with something divine in fact, in addition to being able to represent well the teacher for whom his students sigh, besides of course to reproduce the cliché of forbidden love for someone of the past, In this case, Marion, the strong and feminine character of Karen Allen, a woman who is clearly not a full-time damsel in distress.

With special care for the action, what is also striking is how Spielberg maintains his same technical eye for the most expository scenes. For example, the scene where Indy and Brody (Denholm Elliott) are approached by government officials, and the archaeologist explains the Ark of the Covenant myth to them, Spielberg films much of the dialogue in an open plan with all four characters there, well-disposed through a mise en scène that puts the agents - and the spectator - in a classroom, where Indy even uses the blackboard to present some concepts that will become important in the future; an exhibition that does not sound forced, after all the protagonist is in fact a teacher. We also see Spielberg's brand developing, where the filmmaker works on long shots that always change the characters' positions and the graceful movement of the camera, giving the strong impression that a cut has happened, but remaining in the same shot. Iconography is also a factor that Spielberg and Slocombe masterfully explore, as in the scene where Indy visits Marion in her bar, casting a giant shadow on the girl, but being Marion a fearless woman - and the most memorable one in the archaeologist's gallery - she is very capable of opposing the presence of Indy, and the shadow soon fades over the course of the conversation.

The master of Star Wars songs, conductor John Williams had already been working with Spielberg since ""Jaws"", and not tired of delivering memorable themes, he reaches one of the culminations of his career with the Indiana Jones musical piece. It is a cheerful, adventurous and even flashy theme, which summarizes all the feelings and themes of the franchise, as well as offering emotionally demarcated tracks, such as the love theme with Marion and the most oppressive and heavy orchestra to portray the Nazis. Another work of genius, for a change.

Being an example of the 80s, and literally beginning the decade, the overwhelming majority of the special effects of Hunters are done in a practical way, being done in the studio, unlike the digital effects so common today. It is very good that Spielberg did not like his friend George Lucas who adapted the effects of Star Wars for the ""current times"" which would be to deny the nature of the film and the time in which it was made. The snake scene was made with real snakes (and that scene with a cobra was filmed with a cobra between a glass panel and the actor. The giant ball at the beginning is actually a giant ball, and the scene where Indiana Jones is dragged by a car was filmed that way, with some stuntmen obviously, but Harrison Ford himself was dragged by the car at one point. We have rubber dolls and animatronics to serve as the dead henchmen, while the need for a more supernatural practically takes the film on a path of trash terror. Anyone who watched the film as a child is forever scarred by the images of Nazis having their faces twisted, exploded and melted when the Ark demonstrates the magnitude and horror of its power, and Spielberg and his team have fun here. Okay, the matte paintings and projections of the ""spirits"" of the Ark are images that today appear considerably dated, but still have an impact, as well as the wonderful eighth of the Nazi Ernst Toht (Ronald Lacey) literally melting before our eyes.

One of the great films of Spielberg's career and one of the greatest adventure films of all time. The film, despite being a big blockbuster, still has personal traits of the director who is Jewish, so don't think that the Nazis are villains by chance. Spielberg prints in Caçadores gains a strong and constant critical sub-text that enriches the cinematographic experience, combining narrative lightness with very strong ""strikes"" against the most murderous regime of the 20th century. It is almost like a form of indoctrination in which a certain political position was instilled in the subconscious without our realizing it.

""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" borders on perfection, as it shows that the academic or scientific search can evidently solve some mysteries, while so many others are apparently instituted to be solved with time and investigations that will last for the lives and generations of many scholars, and this feeling gains even more strength with the scene that precedes the credits, where you see a shed with numerous artifacts kept, all waiting to star in one or more adventures of Indiana and yours.

With all these elements well balanced - including a predilection for fantasy - ""The Raiders of the Lost Ark"" became one of the biggest commercial successes in cinema history, competing for eight Oscars and taking four, starting a millionaire franchise and also generating several imitations. We witnessed a perfect adventure film here, being one of the most dignified and perfect examples that the genre has ever seen. Indiana Jones is already born an iconic figure, thanks to the good ideas of George Lucas and the technical virtuosity of Steven Spielberg, who delivers his first great action film in a fun and intelligent way, using the nostalgia of a very specific period to create something completely new."
17. Raiders of the Lost Ark,10/10,A blockbuster how it was meant to be,"Nowadays we keep forgetting how beautiful blockbusters can be. Too much CGI makes everything possible and therefore very often also arbitrary. In Raiders you actually seem to feel the physical pain some of the actors/stuntmen had to go through to provide 2 hours of pure entertainment.

Of course the story isn't waterproof, the Nazi weren't that present in Egypt in 1936 and how did Indy survive that ride on the submarine again? But lots of good and variable action scenes are accompanied by a story that develops fast and excitingly and is always close to being implausible but luckily never is.

Spielberg, Lucas and most of all Harrison Ford created a hero that is nowadays iconic. With their attempt to make an homage to adventure comics of the 1930's they created their own legend.

It's funny, exiting, thrilling and romantic. What more can you ask for?"

17. Raiders of the Lost Ark,8/10,Magnificent action-packed adventure film that spawned two sequels and numerous copies,"It's the first part of adventures trilogy , going on the way of the 30s classic films and the Comics-Books language. The picture blends comedy,adventures action,rip roaring,cliff hunger,tongue-in-cheek and is extremely entertaining and fun . The archaeologist Indiana Jones with his bull whip-wielding and hat will confront dastard Nazis (Ronald Lacey) in Peru, Nepal and Egypt to the obtaining the Moiseh ark with the Covenant's tables . He's only helped by two feisty adventurers (Karen Allen and John Rhys Davies) . Indy fights nasty Arabs , decodes hieroglyphics and faces off hundreds of snakes . The movie attempts to go on the path from great classics during the 30-40s and the comic-books narrative along with the special characteristics of the terror cinema of 80 decade.

Dr.Indiana executes feats of derring-do in various exotics countries. The action highlights include the opening sequence in a Peruvian jungle temple and the creepy and spooky final, but some scenes aren't for squeamish kids . It's realized in James Bond style and high-adventure and it is driven with enormous , formidable fair-play . This breathtaking movie has a number of scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat, but the action never lets up . The enjoyable screenplay was wonderfully written by George Lucas (film's producer) , Philip Kauffman and Lawrence Kasdan . In the picture there're several exotic locations , cliff-hangers, tongue-in-cheek , daring escapes , rip-roaring , derring-do , it is a very bemusing cinematic roller-coaster ride . It's a throw-back to old-fashioned Technicolor amusement with hints of serial with thousands of dollars in budget .

Harrison Ford interprets masterfully the daredevil and brave archaeologist transformed into an action man . Karen Allen plays his untameable and impulsive couple who'll have a little romance with Indy . The movie has great loads of action , special effects galore and the habitual and excellent , as always , John Williams musical core . Dazzling action set-pieces are stunningly mounted by Steven Spielberg . The film has entered the lists of ten most popular of all time . It is followed by ¨Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom¨ and¨ The last Crusade¨. And by the TV series ,also produced by George Lucas : ¨The young Indiana Jones¨with Sean Patrick Flannery .It's a must see for the adventures fans . Rating : Awesome."
17. Raiders of the Lost Ark,7/10,"A good film, but nothing more","'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is a good film, but nothing more than that for me.

Harrison Ford does a sterling job as Indiana Jones, even if his performance does constantly remind me of Steve Martin for some reason. John Rhys-Davies, who I like in James Bond's 'The Living Daylights', fits in well as Sallah. Apart from those two, I don't think any of the others have anything major/memorable about them here - I would've liked to have seen more of Ronald Lacey's Toht.

The adventure side is enjoyable, though everything else is missing a spark in my opinion; a lot of the plot devices are convenient and predictable. The special effects are solid though, as is the score by John Williams.

It makes for a fun enough watch, even if I did expect better.

17. Raiders of the Lost Ark,10/10,"Ba-De-Da, Ba-De-Da-De-Daaaa, Ba-De-Da, Ba-De-Da-De-Da","If you've seen this movie and heard the score, then my one line summary won't read like a mating call for sheep, but rather the absolutely exhilarating ""Raider's March"" which stirs my blood and makes me think of an unforgettable hero, Indiana Jones. If not, see it now.

I love going to movies. I always have. I remember when this film came out. My friends had seen it before I had. They boasted it was great, the best film ever. Some even said it was better than Star Wars (utter blasphemy to a devout 10 year old Jedi-wannabe). I thought no way is this film better than Star Wars, but I was still curious and began the begging of my father to take me.

When I was young, almost all of the films that I had seen, I saw with my Dad. He would take me and my mother would stay at home with my siblings. We saw a number of films that failed to generate a reaction with him as they did with me, but this one was different. This one, my Dad might've enjoyed just as much.

Who can forget the scene where Indy faces bandits in the marketplace, fighting swords with his wits and fists, only to be finally challenged by a dark robed adversary brandishing a heavy, dismembering type of sabre as he swings the impressive blade about his head menacingly?

Indiana looks his opponent up and down briefly and draws his pistol casually and shoots the villain dead as if his patience had been tested a moment longer than he could tolerate.

My father, and the entire audience for that matter, laughed and cheered at this incredible scene. And it was the first time I'd actually been aware of his enjoyment of the film. Usually I'm so transfixed that I wouldn't notice if my legs were on fire. He enjoyed it so much, that he still tends to bring up that scene, even today.

My father and I shared a great moment in movie history, and I will never forget it for as long as I live. I will always be grateful for the time we spent together and the films that I otherwise would have been unable to see without him taking me.

Just a side note about the scene I've described above. It wasn't meant to go that way at all. As Steven Spielberg explained in a television interview, the scene was meant to have an elaborate fight sequence, but Harrison Ford was suffering from diarrhea and couldn't go through with the elaborate set-up required. Someone said, ""the only way we can finish this scene today is if he shoots him"". Steven said, ""Wait a minute, we might have something there.""

As for where it ranks with Star Wars, it's hard for me to say, so I won't. Star Wars was the first film I ever saw, and there's a story in that as well. Thanks again, Dad."
17. Raiders of the Lost Ark,10/10,THE BEST OF THE VERY BEST,"It's odd to think that Tom Selleck was the first choice to play Dr Jones. I doubt he'd have brought Harrison Ford's world weariness that I love to the role. Often imitated never bettered I never tire of watching this movie.

17. Raiders of the Lost Ark,10/10,Amazing action adventure,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is an amazing and deservedly iconic action adventure with plenty of classic lines, superb performances and phenomenal action set pieces that are tense and thrilling. In paying tribute to the classic adventure serials, it creates a timeless blockbuster that's endlessly entertaining.

Harrison Ford gives an amazing lead performance. He's funny, charming and dashing but there's also a palpable exhaustion that really humanises him, reminding you he isn'tinvulnerable. He's supported by Karen Allen who's just as capable and Paul Freeman plays a villain you love to hate.

Steven Spielberg's direction is superb. There's a subtlety to the extended takes that almost go unnoticed and the action scnes have a beautiful rhythm to them. John Williams' score is perfect, one of the best in all of cinema with an instantly recognisable theme thats so triumphant and with a perfect sense of adventure."

18. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,10/10,All Good Things come to an End!,"All the threads of Tolkien's magnum opus come together in the most elegant of fashions in the final part of Peter Jackson's adaptation. Humanity makes a last stand at Minas Tirith, the Hobbits travel through Mordor, our heroes try to by time for Frodo to complete his mission and the Evil Sauron gets tired of the whole game and lashes out with all his might and fury.

""Return of the King"" is 4 hours of payoff, a third act in a gigantic epic rather than a mere film of its own. As such it is intensely dramatic and dynamic and you can very much sense that though peter Jackson spared no effort on the previous episodes, this is clearly his favorite. the film floats by at a thunderous pace, taking us through unforgettable moments such as the battle of Minas Tirith itself, a marvel of seamless animation and epic film-making, it demands to be seen, as it has too many jaw-dropping moments to choose from. The quieter character moments keep gaining in potency and the full weight of the stakes and their heartbreaking consequences is never in doubt.

The cast of these films have played their parts to perfection and again Jackson deserves overall credit for choosing actors that so perfectly match Tlolkien's creations: Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are their own usually excellent selves, and the hobbits remain endearing, but of all the uniformly great cast, the true standouts are Viggo Mortensen and David Wenham as the tragic Faramir, whose relationship with his brutish father is the most traumatic of the film. Jackson pushes them even further by having them sing at a few key moments (a practice employed to powerful effect by Tolkien in the books), a daring undertaking that works wonders. And though he may offer one ending too many, he does have the decency to show off each surviving character with the appropriate screen time and respect.

Now that the trilogy is complete, it can be viewed as one big film, as it should be. After 8 years, Jackson has done the impossible: he has taken Tolkien's huge legend and made films that stand on their own and have revolutionized film-making, setting the new benchmark for cinematic epics. Changes have been made to Tolkien's source novels, but they make for better, more fluid films, more faithful in spirit to Tolkien's myth than anyone had the right to hope for.

A masterpiece, whether as part of a bigger whole or on its own. Well deserving of all the high praise thrown at it, and then some..."

18. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,10/10,Still the greatest movie ever made,"Nothing even comes close and I may well not see it personally topped. Every single scene is magnificent. The acting is superb as is the direction, script, hauntingly beautiful music, cinematography and the incredible battles; especially the hour long battle on the Pellenor Fields and Minas Tirith. The characters are some of the greatest ever created and to root for. The movie is simply perfection from beginning to end and the 4 hour version is just as majestic. There's not a single negative thing I can say about a movie that deserves all it's nominated Oscars. My family and I watched it 4 times in its first 12 days of release. A joyous experience every time. Magnificent!!!!!!

18. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,10/10,Pretty much outstanding,"I admit it, I love all three Lord of the Rings films. People may say Return of the King is the best of the trilogy, some may say it is the worst. I personally think Two Towers is the best for its scope and better exploration of some of the characters, but while it is still great Return of the King is better than Fellowship of the Ring.

My only slight disappointment is the ending, it does feel overlong and bloated for me, almost as if there was more than one ending filmed. That said, what does make the ending at least watchable for me is the way it is shot, the marvellous score and the performance of Gollum.

Despite this minor discrepancy, Return of the King is extremely good and in my view one of the better Best Picture winners last decade. Peter Jackson's direction is very impressive here, and the scope is massive and just dazzling to watch. All three films of the trilogy are very well made, but Return of the King defines the term epic. The cinematography is mind-blowing, the scenery is superb, the costumes and make-up are well tailored, the effects are superb and don't distract too much and the lighting is authentic.

The score is phenomenal. Fellowship of the Ring had some ethereal, rousing, haunting and charming themes, whereas Two Towers was somewhat darker and more complex. Return of the King merges these together and the result is a perfect mixture of charm, darkness, etherality and complexity. The story is compelling with themes of friendship, strength and loyalty, the screenplay is well-written and literate and while the film is very long the three hours or so fly by seamlessly. The characters are engaging, Aragorn is even more interesting here than he is in the previous films while Gollum continues to steal every scene he appears in.

The acting is very good. Orlando Bloom(who I can find dashing yet uncharismatic and bland) and John Rhys-Davies are given less to do but do carry their parts very well, and Elijah Wood is likable enough. Sean Astin captures Sam perfectly and provides the heart of the picture, and Viggo Mortenssen is at his charismatic best here. Ian McKellen is perfectly cast, while the design of Gollum is still superb and Andy Serkis is equally phenomenal. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of any Sarauman, but I was more than I was satisfied with the final result.

All in all, an outstanding entry to a great trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
18. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,10/10,Unprecedented.,
18. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,10/10,They saved the best for last,"Obviously, I'm aware of the fact that the Lord of the Rings trilogy is actually one giant movie, but since it was released in parts, that's how I'm judging them. The Return Of The King is the final chapter, and since it is the climax and resolution of the epic journey, it has a little more intensity and urgency than the previous installments.

At this point everyone has come to know and love all of the characters, and the stakes have become tremendously high. Kingdoms are at their knees, and the only two characters who can save the day are getting weaker and weaker. The tension was very high in this episode and I can honestly say that out of all 3 this was the only one that had me on the edge of my seat. There were many memorable scenes (one of my favourites including the part with the giant spider)that made this the classic that it is sure to stay for decades to come.

This is the longest of the series, mostly because of the ending that seems to last a while. This was a good ending, and I can see why Frodo did what he did. He, and us the audience, have gone through an incredible ordeal and I think we needed that 20 minute linger. When the battle is over, and the celebrations have ended, there is a sad emptiness felt. The films spanned over 3 years, there have been the extended cuts of course, but after that, it's all over. Peter Jackson gave us an ending that was both appropriate and admirable.

These were some amazing movies and this one in particular is the best, in my opinion. As whole, the Lord Of The Rings is a phenomenon. An absolute phenomenon. Much more than just movies. They have a universal appeal and have touched the hearts and imaginations of millions. I'm one of them.

Sorry if I'm being all fanboyish and kissing this movie's ass, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favourites but generally this seems to be the movie event of the century. There will never be another Lord of the Rings film, and that's a bit depressing.

My rating: 10/10"
18. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,10/10,I lived to see them all!,"I am in awe of the knowledge of some of the reviewers. I've been disappointed with virtually every film version of a beloved book that I have seen. I have not studied ""The Lord of the Rings"" though I have read the trilogy twice and parts several times. I know what a scholar Tolkien was and admire his work in linguistics as well as storytelling. The two entities do not need to cross over. If one really wanted to make the book you would have about two hours of poetry and a 56 hour movie. Movie-making is, unfortunately, forced to play by different rules. First of all, this film could not have been made until now. Imagine people dressed as trees. Remember those old Superman serials where whenever the Man of Steel flies, he becomes animated. Now that is genuinely bad. What Peter Jackson did here will be his legacy; had he died the day the film was complete, he would go down in film history. Everything is set up. The ring must be returned. Frodo is drunk with power and is latched on by the forces of evil. Those continuing the quest must face the ultimate and some do. Gollum is in the way, using his wiles to drive the ring back to him. The visual magnificence of Mount Doom and Mordor are unbelievable. One thing that is never mentioned is the incredible acting of most of the characters. Jackson may be a master of spectacle, but Frodo's character is a mass of impulses and expressions. He believes he is going to die and is afraid. Do you see a little bit of Christianity mixed in here? I'm not going down that road because, of course, the Bible is an epic too and has its own story. This is a movie about how friendship, loyalty, and sacrifice will out against evil. The evil is so remarkable and so oppressive.

I can't begin to talk in the terms of other reviewers, but I do need to make sure that I weigh in on this film and the other two because this is a product of our society that we can all be proud of."

18. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,10/10,Part 3: It's Not Really the Thought that Counts,"Just as Peter Jackson felt that LOTR had to be made as one large, three-part, cinematic piece, I decided to write my IMDb review of all three movies as a single, multi-part essay. Click on my screen-name and hit ""Chronological"" to view my reviews of the Fellowship and Two Towers. I make no guarantees about the quality and consistence of my review, but I do guarantee that these three films offer very high and very consistent quality from beginning to end. The acting, cinematography, art, and direction simply can not be beat.

Which of the three movies is my favorite varies with my mood  and the same holds true for Tolkien's books. When I am immersed in the story, ROTK is my favorite. When I simply want to have fun with the whole experience, I love Fellowship. And when I want something intense, evocative and thoughtful, I go for the Two Towers.

Frodo, Sam and Golem are on their way to Mount Doom and their bodies, nerves, and relationships have borne the greatest burden on middle earth. The rest of the fellowship is rallying to the defense of Minas Tirith, and preparing for even more deadly battles to come.

The heroism and romance are incredibly moving - when was the last time you saw an entire audience leaving a theater after a fantasy movie rubbing their eyes? The sets are breathtaking - even moreso than in the previous two films.

The casting and acting are superb.

The film delivers at every level and is the jewel in the trilogy's well-earned crown.

Return of the King offers a resolution of all of the major story arcs in LOTR. As with the classic Tolkien trilogy, however, you may be able to predict some of what will occur, but never all of it and you'll never guess how you will get there. The same fatalistic and paradoxically unpredictable feeling of Tolkien's grand plots is present throughout ROTK especially. The major theme in ROTK, however, is the varied ways and means of heroism  both intentional and unintended, and Tolkien's examination of sacrifice and heroism is as inspiring as it is subtle. Amazingly, it all comes through in the films.

Even more than the previous two films, Jackson and his writers took liberties with the story-line. Like the others, however, this serves the film better than simple adaptation from one medium to another. By reordering some of the chronology and adding scenes and plot devices which are consistent with Tolkien's world and characterizations, the film-makers actually do a better job of preserving the concepts and themes of the story than they could have with a pure adaptation. The lengthy epilogue in Tolkien's book is greatly reduced, reordered, and somewhat changed in order to work in the film. Some parts actually appear very early in ROTK. And some aspects of Tolkien's epilogue are disclosed in the Two Towers, though not directly depicted. But all of the really important components of the epilogue are, at least strongly implied if not well illustrated in ROTK."
18. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,10/10,Perfect way to finish the trilogy,
18. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,9/10,A monumental film,"Feeling weary and battle-worn, I have just staggered out of the cinema after three and a half hours of special effects creatures fighting other special effects creatures. I had taken refreshments but barely touched them - probably because the film I had watched is one of the most mesmerising, evocative, inspiring, and awesome I have witnessed of any big adventure epic. Not to mention superb ensemble acting, moods that shift effortlessly between mediaeval battles of colossal proportions and convincing bloodshed, beauty and wonderment, fantastic natural and artificial landscapes and cityscapes, touches of humour, well-paced dramatic tension, and human bonding that is moving enough to just let you dry your eyes as the unassuming credits flash by.

Return of the King is the greatest of the Tolkien trilogy by New Zealand director Peter Jackson. Although I've seen the other two and read the book, I felt it would also stand alone well enough for people who hadn't done either.

The storytelling is much more professional that the first one - which maybe laboured to introduce so much information - or the second one - which has little let up from the tension of long battle scenes. In Return of the King, there is an emotional sting at the start, as we watch the transformation of Gollum from warm, fun-loving guy to murderous, mutated wretch. The movie then moves deftly between different segments of the story - the sadness of the lovely soft-focus Liv Tyler as fated Arwen whose travails and woman's love succeeds in having the Sword that was Broken mended, the comradeship of Sam and Frodo (Sean Astin & Elijah Wood) that is tested to the limits, the strong commanding presence of Gandalf (Ian McKellen) who keeps an eye on things whilst turning in an Oscar-worthy performance, the ingenious and very varied battle scenes, and the mythical cities of that rise out of the screen and provide key plot elements.

This is a fairy story of human endeavour, the defeating of power cliques and the triumph of the human spirit that could almost be compared to Wagner's Gotterdammerung. It is a fairy story without any sugary sweetness, a fairy story the likes of which hasn't been told so well before, and is even unlikely to be done so well in the future. The haunting scream of the Nasgul stays with you, the physical attractions are not airbrushed, and the battles are about as far from pantomime characters waving wooden swords as you can get. The ingenious monsters keep you on the edge of your seat. The whole narrative maintains the spirit (if not archival, detailed accuracy) of the original and makes you want to read the book (or read the book again!)

The worst I can say about it is that it is maybe a tad long - but not that you'd notice . . ."
18. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,10/10,Brilliant. Simply brilliant,"Where to start with this masterpiece? Quite simply one of the greatest movies ever made. A fitting end to a stunning trilogy. The acting as it has been is brilliant again. Special mention must go to Sean Austin, for his performance as Sam. In this one he gets his big moment in the trilogy, and he nails it perfectly. His scenes with Elijah Wood (Frodo) on Mount Doom, as Frodo weakens are full of emotion and very powerful. As for the rest of the movie? It has one of the greatest scenes EVER in a movie : the riders of Rohan charging into battle outside Minas Tirith. You simply cannot tell where the real riders end, and the CGI begins. The battles again are well done, and not simply a repeat of the siege at Helms Deep in The Two Towers.

As I said, the acting is again first rate from the entire cast. And it was nice to see Andy Serkis getting his face on screen as Smeagol, before his transformation into Gollum.

By the end of the movie, there were more than a few tears as the boat left the Grey Havens, as the movie ended on a quiet emotional note, after the epic battles before.

I could happily have sat through this again and again. Well done to everyone, both in front and behind the cameras for such a brilliant work, but of course special mention has to go to Peter Jackson. He deserves every award he's received for this.

One last point. If you only seen the theatrical release, then go get the extended version of this film. It's even better!!"
18. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,10/10,A fantastic conclusion to a great trilogy,
18. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,10/10,I doubt there will ever be a film made of this quality again.,"Frodo and Sam continue their desperate journey to destroy the ring, Gollum has his eyes very much on the prize, knowing they cannot possibly get past Sauron's army, Aragorn creates a diversion.

Surely this is a contender for the greatest film of all time, I can think of nothing negative to say, it's everything you want in a movie and more. Action packed, intriguing, funny and several scenes that will pull a few years from your eyes.

The greatest battle scenes of all time, they are as relentless as they are breathtaking, if you like action, this is the film for you.

There isn't a single lull, at no point does it ever dip, it doesn't matter which character the focus is on, it captivates, that opening sequence with Gollum was off the scale, as was the final, epic battle.

I will only watch the extended version, as I find Christopher Lee's absence in the theatrical cut unforgivable, I know it's about four hours long, but that doesn't matter, you lose all sense of time in the wonder and brilliance.

McKellen, Mortensen, Wood, everyone associated, incredible.

This film truly is one of the best ever made.

It's not perfect since there are no perfect movies actually. But this one is the Achievement of being the closest to the perfect for me.

This movie is the best movie of the all time for me, clearly. I just gained my Cinema love with this movie. And I watched more than a thousand movies. I watched so many directors from so many countries. My cinema taste changed too much since my first watch of this movie. But this movie is still the best for me, not even a single movie reached to it's level. This is why I think the movie is the best movie of the future also. I don't think my thoughts will ever change.

This movie is not about the war of men and orcs or any other peoples. This movie about the insignificant people versus the worlds biggest thread ever. That thread is actually unbeatable.

""You did not seriously think that a hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron? There are none who can. Against the power of Mordor there can be no victory.""


""Hobbits really are amazing creatures. You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month, and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you at a pinch.""


Both dialogues from the first movie. One of them telling us evil side is unbeatable and the other one tells we have a Hobbit. Brilliant and the most effective storyline. And they adapted it amazingly well!"

19. Goodfellas,10/10,In one word: perfection,"Needs to be seen to be believed; in one word: perfection. Every frame, every voice-over, every song - it all comes together at the exact right moment to create the perfect film experience. This film makes you really understand and feel what makes the American mafia so compelling; in the eyes of a kid, who was unfortunate enough to grow up in a tough neighborhood, those gangsters are rock stars. Live fast, die young - but when you die, it ain't gonna be of a glamorous suicide or drug overdose - the ending will be brutal, ugly and sad. And it may very well be one of your best friends that will blow your brains out.

I'll never get tired of watching Goodfellas; the entertainment value of this film is just amazing. It doesn't happen very often that every person involved in the process of making a film is at the peak of his/her game. And rarely do art and entertainment come together the way they did here. Storytelling with impeccable pacing, this is what it's like when a master composer conducts his masterpiece. All hail the king; the most versatile and talented filmmaker of his generation: Martin Scorsese.

19. Goodfellas,10/10,The best mobster film ever made,
19. Goodfellas,10/10,A great director at the peak of his talents,"It is hard to describe the brilliance that is Goodfellas. As good as Raging Bull and Taxi Driver are, I think Goodfellas is Martin Scorsese's best film and is a textbook example of a great director at the peak of his talents. The film crackles with raw energy and enthusiasm, the film is superbly directed and the final sequence is nothing short of stunning. The script is also excellent with memorable quotes, the story is never less than compelling and the pop and rock soundtrack is winning. The cinematography and detail is immaculate, and the ensemble cast is one of film's finest. Joe Pesci won an Oscar for his performance, and as good as he was, he is perfectly matched by Robert DeNiro and Ray Liotta. All in all, it is a brilliant film and an instant classic no matter what time, day, week or year. 10/10 Bethany Cox

19. Goodfellas,10/10,One word: priceless,"If there was one word that I could use to describe Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"": it'd be priceless.

A surreal and deeply fascinating take on life of Henry Hill who was involved in the Mob for three decades and his rise throughout the time span (and Nicholas Pileggi's book ""Wiseguy"").

There isn't a single moment in the movie where it doesn't miss a beat, you could only tell by the atmosphere of the time period and it seems so real.

The performances in this film simply make it even more memorable and how the characters are portrayed here especially by Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci (who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), and Paul Sorvino are believable and easy to understand that they were a family, very close and tightly knit to the core. Also, how director Martin Scorsese lets the movie pace itself and keeps the viewer off guard in what happens deserves a lot of credit."
19. Goodfellas,10/10,The greatest mob film still today,"Amazing is the one and only word to say for this film. I have always thought that Goodfellas was one of the greatest films ever made and set a landmark in the 90's or even in movie history. I bought Goodfellas last week and I got to watch the film a couple days ago. I really just couldn't lay my eyes off the film and everything about it was just simply worth watching. The acting was excellent, Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and other actors did great and almost all of the characters they portrayed were 100% accurate. The camera-work also was brilliant and Martin Scorsese does a beautiful job by putting excellent camera shots in his films and I give him high credit for that. The soundtrack too is one of the best soundtracks ever made and the song ""Layla,"" put chills down my spine of how great this song fitted the film. Overall, Martin Scorsese made his best film in my opinion and him and Nicholas Pileggi made an excellent and sharp script that made this, the greatest mob film still today.

Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10!! **** A+"
19. Goodfellas,9/10,The Criminal Mindset,"The gangster film has been redefined so many times in cinema history it will be interesting to see how it is redefined once again. Goodfellas is a milestone film in that regard because just as Public Enemy and Little Caesar defined it in the Thirties, The Godfather trilogy in the seventies and eighties, Goodfellas set the standard that all other films including Martin Scorsese similar Casino try to meet. The interesting thing is that Martin Scorsese is young enough to redefine it again with another work.

With Ray Liotta narrating his own life in crime in a flashback as real life criminal Henry Hill, Martin Scorsese offers us one fascinating glimpse of the criminal life in the Eisenhower to Reagan era. Henry Hill even as a child got sucked into the criminal life as a kid, as he said all he ever wanted to be was a gangster. Tutored by both Robert DeNiro and Paul Sorvino, Liotta takes part in one of the biggest heists of all time of Lufthansa Airlines at JFK Airport during the seventies. Goodfellas is the story of the events from Henry Hill's perspective leading up to the heist and the aftermath.

For myself I've never seen the gangster mentality better expressed on screen except maybe by Sean Connery in Family Business. Liotta and Connery operate from the same mindset. If you work hard and hope it pays off in success, you're a dope. If you want something, just take it. When you come right down to it, that's how criminals think, it's the rest of us who are fools.

Goodfellas was nominated for several Oscars, but came away with only one winner, Joe Pesci in the role of crazy Tommy DeVito. He's another criminal type, one who's driven by a terrible inferiority complex due to his short stature and does terrible things even to his own peers. And those peers don't forget as you see what happens to Pesci in Goodfellas. This turned out to be a career role for Pesci. He's a multi-talented man who's got an incredible range and can play everything from the Home Alone comedies to stone killers like here in Goodfellas or in Casino.

There's usually a contest in which Scorsese fans argue whether Casino or Goodfellas is better. I happen to like Casino, but without the success of Goodfellas, Casino would not have been made.

For a fascinating look at the criminal mindset, Goodfellas is an absolute must."
19. Goodfellas,10/10,Martin Scorsese's masterpiece.,"The story of Henry Hill's life from youth to adulthood, from his own words.

'Never rat on your friends, and always keep your mouth shut.' The lines are as sharp as those suits.

Martin Scorsese's incredible masterpiece still holds up as an out and out classic. Easily one of the best films to come out of the 90's, the direction, the visuals, the storyline are all fantastic, it's a film that never dates, it's as gritty, hard hitting and stylish as ever.

The characters are incredibly rich, and there's such a variety of them. Some of the most awesome acting you'll see, the likes of De Niro, Liotta, Pesci and Sorvino,

I can only imagine just how many films and TV series that this film inspired.

One of the best films ever made, 10/10."
19. Goodfellas,10/10,A classic. Durp.,"My goodness. If you ain't seen, and much worse, don't care for this movie... I don't wanna associate w you. 30 years later it's still considered possibly the best gangster film of all time. Watch.

19. Goodfellas,6/10,As good as those fellas are...I just don't get it,
19. Goodfellas,10/10,Instant classic,
19. Goodfellas,8/10,A classic mobster film.,"This is one hell of a film about the mobsters, based on a true story and coming from one of the great directors of all time. This is about Henry Hill, the narrator of the story, an Irish simple person who gets involved with the Mafia at a very young age and continues his life through it. There is no major plot in this film, just isolated incidents one of which was the turning point of Hill's life. Scorsese, as brilliant as he ever was, shows violence, sex and drugs etc in his own trademark style. And his actors helps him to make this film one of the classics.

Robert DeNiro is not present in much of the film, nor his acting leaves too much impression. The three actors who really did their best job here are Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci and Lorraine Bracco. I hate to say that most youngsters today don't know too much about Liotta or how talented he was. I asked my younger brother about him and he said, ""The man who did the voice on GTA: Vice City?"". This is partly because Liotta did not get too many big roles after that, especially in recent years. But here he is just brilliant as Hill. It's Pesci's one of the best too. Playing a mad mobster with dark sense of humor wasn't his usual type. And Lorraine Bracco becomes the perfect lead female in such type of films.

The film's got smart screenplay and excellent cinematography. And I don't know how many times Scorsese will be denied his Academy recognition. I hate to see a lifetime achievement award as his first Oscar. But things are going like that."
19. Goodfellas,10/10,Scorsese's masterpiece stands the test of time,
19. Goodfellas,8/10,Slightly disappointed but still very good,"Having never seen it before but heard so much about it I was expecting it to be one of the best films I've ever seen instead it was just very good in my eyes. Potentially it has lost some originality by so many other films copying features of it that it just didn't seem new anymore but whilst nothing was wrong with it and like I said it was very good with some fantastic performances it just didn't stand out against so many others of this genre for me.

19. Goodfellas,10/10,Rightfully hailed as one of the greatest gangster epics of all time,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits

A film (one I'm sure you're all familiar with) charting the rise of Henry Hill, a young man growing up in a neighbourhood in 1950s New Jersey, who is in awe of the wise guys who lurk in his neighbourhood and the respect and power they command. With low prospects and an abusive father, Henry can see no other way to go than to become one of them and we follow him on his journey as he becomes ingratiated in them, the crimes he carries out for them, his marriage that starts well before going disasterously off the rails, a spell in jail after a job gone wrong and finally where he goes wildly off the rails when he starts taking/dealing drugs and him finally ending up having to testify against his former friends when he becomes a liability to them and they put out a contract on his head, which is still in force today.

Robert De Niro. Ray Liotta. Joe Pesci. Three men with faces you wouldn't want to mess with and all perfectly cast in the leading roles in Martin Scorsese's legendary crime epic. All men are on fine form but, in ironically the lesser role, special mention to Pesci who steals the show as the wildly psychotic Tommy.

Scorsese's masterpiece was one of the first films to really make use of the camera in new ways, from the long, lingering shot to the still shot, used excellently at various points in the movie. These are usually complimented by a fine 50s soundtrack playing over them, with some real lingering melodies from that era.

The story works on two levels, both enlighteningly as an expose of how the gangster world and the gangsters themselves actually have very similar philosophies and worries as normal 9-5 people (with regards to families and staying on top of the competition) as well as showing just why the attraction to that life is so great (hitting home most forcefully at the end when Henry is forced to acknowledge that he'll have to lead the rest of his life like a 'shnuck!') and also engagingly as we watch a man rise from nothing to great heights only to lose it all again through his own bad choices and misguided loyalties. Indeed, as the film spans four decades, we do leave the film feeling as though we've known these characters for years.

Coppola's The Godfather will remain the most accomplished crime epic of all time, but Scorsese's effort can never be scoffed at and will rightly remain one of the most well remembered films of it's sort, if you've got the stomach to sit through it in certain parts. *****"
19. Goodfellas,7/10,"Slick, flashy, often brilliant, yet cannot make you give a hoot about its characters",
20. Parasite,10/10,One of the best films of this decade,"I am remarkably stingy with my 10/10 ratings. I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. Of the roughly 2600 titles I've rated on here, only 34 have a 10. Parasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.

I'm going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn't know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.

What I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I've seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013).

And it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast. All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree; the amount of conflict, drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering. You come to care for just about all of them.

I'm stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie. And sure, I've seen many movies that are hard to fault, but it's rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect. It's extremely entertaining, thoroughly moving in so many different ways, and as icing on the cake there's a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie's over (and this one's not going to leave my head for a while, I can tell).

Catch this one when you can and believe the hype. Joon-Ho Bong has made many great films (and so far no bad one's), but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others.

When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was, this one will surely be up there."
20. Parasite,8/10,"You name a genre, this movie covers it","I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that contained as many genres as 'Parasite'. The movie starts out almost like an 'Ocean's Eleven' heist film and then expands into a comedy, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, crime and even horror film. It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too.

I love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high.

The film was incredibly entertaining too. I can't think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening, at least in terms of action. Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this. I had a great time with 'Parasite' and I think most that give it a chance will too."
20. Parasite,10/10,Meritocracy: it's metaphorical,"In a meritocracy, success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it--those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, and for some lucky Cinderella, plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns, the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society: ""I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired; you, too, can achieve you dreams, if only you try.""

The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition, backstabbing, deceit, and callousness. You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one, and then, perhaps, when you at last feel secure, you can afford to be kind and confident and generous. ""It's easy to be nice when you're rich,"" the mother in this film (Jang Hye-jin) at one point observes.

But it's a very long and very crooked ladder, and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip, and sometimes they've been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you, and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down--either by those above you or, just as often, by those staring up from the ground below. There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder.

But in a meritocracy, you can't blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it. Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it. No, you must blame yourself. You should have tread more carefully. You should have climbed more quickly. You should have used a firmer and more precise grip, anticipated disasters, and known just when to leap. If you fail in a meritocracy, it's all your fault. You should have tried harder. Better luck next time.

Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), the young man who is the main character of PARASITE, several times refers to ""metaphors,"" and the film itself is, of course, a metaphor. On a surface level, viewers are treated to a very thrilling, engaging, well-paced and well-plotted crime story. At all times, however, bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film, there are deeply personal, meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer. These insights are rarely foregrounded. They are so subtly interwoven, in fact, that if you're like me, you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate, humanist story you've just witnessed. Bong Joon-ho's filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he'll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he's done so.

I want to avoid spoilers here, but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece--beautifully lensed, enthrallingly edited, superbly acted, and intimately involving.

South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States, and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky. Higher education is widespread, so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs. I lived in Korea once, and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week--public school, English-immersion private school, piano class, soccer team, taekwondo, math camp, chess club, and so on. I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary, but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that, who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long. As the father (Song Kang-ho) in the film at one point says, this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job. One can't afford not to struggle.

The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, however. They are the story of global capitalism, and the specter of American materialism (and imperialism; note the ""Indians"") looms heavily over the film. Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all. It's nice to dream, and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine, and how nice an ending it is when they do. But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be, maybe, just whims and fancy. More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage."
20. Parasite,10/10,For those who didn't like the movie because of its second half,
20. Parasite,10/10,Thoroughly entertaining,
20. Parasite,10/10,A true masterpiece.,"This movie is a gosh darn masterpiece. It will make you belly laugh, it will chill you to the bone, and it will make you shed a tear. This movie will stay with you long after the credits are over.

20. Parasite,10/10,Thought It Might Win Best Foreign Movie,
20. Parasite,9/10,Multilayered portrayal of the real Korea,"This is a movie about a class struggle in South Korea, like what movie ""Us"" attempts to do but done properly. It is a stark reminder of what true living standards for most South Koreans look like, and its realism is very painful. Few are aware of the fact that up to the 1980s, South Korea was in fact more impoverished than North Korea, and it was only late that the situation reversed with famines of the 90s etc, but many people still live miserable lives, and situation is very similar to that in China, where a few got gloriously rich but the urban masses still live in bug infested cheap dwellings.

Some crafty members of this underclass manage to con contemptuous rich man into employing them as his servants. For many Asians smell is a way to express utter contempt, and this is often directed against the white people, who, being able to process milk, smell ""like butter"" and are seen in rac ist light as unclean, but the same rac ist contempt is directed towards the poor. The poor accept these valuations and fight for the crumbles, like roaches in the dark, but in life and death situations, resentment might boil up and the contempt might cost the rich their empty heads.

The movie paints a sad picture of modern East Asian societies, with many subtle points, criticizes their culture and emulation of the America, with a few cruel but precise strokes. The sheer talent of the Korean filmmaker, but also the fact that West likes movies from foreign countries that are self bashing, allowing the worst condescension rooted in colonialism that failed miserably in East Asia to thrive, one more reason to cheer this slightly overrated movie."
20. Parasite,9/10,An original dark comedy about class struggles,"This is a well written and well perfomed original film. With a lot of repetitive cinema these day i felt this was something new. I felt connected and engaged with the character throughout the film. There are several well directed tense moments throughout the film. A popular topic of class struggled well portrayed. Its always nice to see foreign language films having worldwide success.

20. Parasite,9/10,Totally Unique,"Usually I don't read reviews before seeing a film. This one, however, I did, and happily so. First of all, it was good to know what cinema in Korea is all about. We need to shed our cultural biases, including ""how"" to make films. This had a very clever plot and an engaging group of characters. The title, I assume, means the principle figures have managed to infest a body and then use it to sustain themselves. I hope to see more from this director in the future.

20. Parasite,9/10,Achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us,"As a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.

That's not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means, but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare, writer-director Bong Joon-ho is in a class of his own.

The film follows a lower-class South Korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper-class family and their lavish household. As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.

It's a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.

However, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times. Go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride."

Probably the best experience in recent times. Its pure art resembles the modern society the emotions they had shelved are insanely exceptional a layered masterpiece. If you like dark thrillers then you shouldn't miss Mr. Bong joon-ho's Parasite. Definitely tops the list of best movies in 2019.

20. Parasite,10/10,Incredible.,"Possibly the best film I've seen for some time, yes I have a few lockdown blues, and needed something to cause a bit of escapism, Parasite was the answer. It's one of those films that's almost impossibility to classify, it doesn't really fit into any specific genre, but covers almost all of them.

A great start, it holds your attention incredibly well, I enjoyed the latter stages as much as the first part of the film, I know some didn't. It just moves you into a totally different place.

You'll laugh, and cry, you'll lose yourself in the wonder. Do yourself a favour and order it, 10/10.

20. Parasite,10/10,Thy shall not ridicule fellas with body odor. Definitely deserves the best picture award.,"Finally saw this much talked about film. As a fan of Korean thrillers, this film surpassed my expectations. The film is about a poor family who cleverly n cunningly become employed by a wealthy couple, posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.

The film begins like a dark satire, it then proceeds into a captivating thriller n ends like a surreal crime.

The film is very entertaining inspite of the sad stuff shown about poor fellas but mind u, it is not at all demeaning. It is very gripping n weirdly hilarious.

20. Parasite,9/10,"Class struggle. After Karl Marx and Victor Hugo, here is Joon-ho Bong","This cinematographic gem has been recently rewarded by the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Festival. If I have one and only one advice to give you: go savor this fabulous movie with a strict minimum of information! Indeed, this film might schematically be split in two parts, the second one being quite surprising and unpredictable. The script is excellent and the casting is globally sumptuous, especially the gorgeous Cho Yeo-jeong for whom I may confess I have a crush.

As a postscript, an anecdote certainly insignificant but literally astonishing when you're French: in the middle of the film, the proletarian family gives itself up to an orgy, the coffee table being covered with manifold dishes including two French cheeses as industrial as cheap: « Le rustique » and « Bresse bleu ». Unbelievable!

20. Parasite,9/10,"Parasite Review: Comedy, drama, suspense, and yes, even horror.","A family who doesn't have a lot of money or opportunities in life, starts working for a wealthy family. But will this change the life of the poor family?

DIRECTOR: Bong Joon Ho SCREENWRITERS: Bong Joon Ho, Han Jin Wan CAST: Song Kang Ho, Lee Sun Kyun, Cho Yeo Jeong, Choi Woo Shik, Park So Dam, Lee Jung Eun, Chang Hyae Jin In the movie, we follow the Kim family who doesn't have much money. By chance, the son in the family starts working for the wealthy Park family. He teaches their daughter English. Now the rest of the family sees opportunities to make money, and they have a plan to remove the rest of the staff who work for the wealthy Park family and then take the jobs themselves.

Bong Joon Ho addresses deeper themes, but he always manages to create entertainment and some surprising scenes that bring out the smile. The movie is mostly charming until the Kim family discovers the big secret of the house.

Then the movie starts to get darker, and it explodes into a wonderful finale where we see and understand the message of the movie. The title of the movie turns things on its head. Because what I thought to be quite obvious at the beginning of the movie is turned upside down and I got an aha experience. Parasites are found in all classes of society.

From a technical aspect I think this was a beautifully crafted film from the direction to the cinematography. There are so many beautiful scenes in the movie, and it's pretty well done considering that most of the action takes place inside the big house and the not so big garden.My favorite sequence is when the Kim family has to run home when the rain is pouring down, and you feel like they're on board the Titanic. They must run from the top and down to the engine room. What a wonderful sequence, and it's so beautiful to watch!

The cast was fantastic, and everyone fit the needs of their roles. The characters were well-written with the performances complementing that perfectly. It does a great job of creating a collection of characters that feel like real people, whom despite their eccentricities, maintained a grounded, realistic feel.The musical score complements the scenes nicely and elevates the emotional responses without feeling overbearing.

So, if you like foreign films, thrillers, or movies that can make you think a little check this one out. It's a crisp film from a technical aspect, and with a blend of great writing and acting you can't go wrong. It was a solid film that treats the audience with intelligence. 9/10"
20. Parasite,8/10,"""If you make a plan, life never works out that way.""",
20. Parasite,7/10,Lacks any realistic human dimension,"South Korean director Bong Joon-ho (""Okja"") says that he always tries to overturn viewer expectations and hopes that his latest film succeeds in this way. Palme d'Or winner at the 2019 Cannes Film festival, Bong's Parasite (Gisaengchung) does indeed thwart expectations, but the question is - to what end? Defying any strict genre classification, the film is a conglomeration of comedy, drama, satire, crime, horror, and anything else you can throw into the mix. Bong sees the film as a statement about the ""ranks and classes"" inherent in capitalism that are invisible to the eye, and says that the film ""depicts the inevitable cracks that appear when two classes brush up against each other in today's increasingly polarized society."" Unfortunately, the characterizations are filled with so many stereotypes that the lack of any realistic human dimension leaves Bong's statement without much impact.

The film looks at class differences between two families - one well-to-do, and the other n'eer do well. For the Kim family, life is a struggle. They live in a cramped bug-infested basement apartment without many amenities except for a toilet built on kind of a shelf. The father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho, ""Snowpiercer"") has failed in business and has accumulated many debts. His son and daughter Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik, ""Train to Busan"") and Ki-jung (Park So-dam, ""Cinderella and Four Knights"" TV series) have repeatedly failed college entrance exams. The mother Chung-sook (Hyae-jin Jang, ""Adulthood"") along with the two children fold boxes for a delivery company, but cannot even get that right. Not to worry, they leave their windows open when the fumigators come around to get some free extermination and steal free Wi-Fi from the next door coffee shop.

On the other hand, the nouveau riche Park family has all the advantages. Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun, ""Jo Pil-ho: The Dawning Rage"") is the CEO of a high-tech company and the family lives in a spacious, modernistic home protected by sturdy concrete walls. He has an attractive somewhat fragile wife Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong, ""The Target""), a teenage daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so, ""The Tiger""), and a hyper-active young son Da-song (Jung Hyun-jun). Being wealthy and somewhat elitist in their attitude, for Bong, they are ideally suited to be torn apart by ruthless grifters. With the aid of a friend, Ki-woo is hired to be a private tutor for Da-hye. Of course, he has to forge university documents to convince the trusting Mrs. Park of his competence. With that conquest out of the way, the cunning Ki-woo concocts a scheme to secure jobs in the Park household for his entire family.

Convinced that their young son is a budding Picasso, Mrs. Park hires Ki-jung as an art teacher, then falls for invented stories impugning the character of their driver and housekeeper to provide some more employment opportunities for the Kims, this time for the deadbeat dad Ki-taek and his wife Chung-sook. Bong said that ""Sometimes with the characters in my films, I look at them cynically, but most of the time I have a lot of compassion for the characters, even with the villains."" This compassion, however, does not seem to extend to the loyal, hardworking household workers, their work scammed out of existence. Without going into detail, the whole escapade backfires in a twist that is over-the-top unsettling even though utterly implausible.

Worthy of a Mack Sennett comedy, a sweet family drama turns into a tumultuous melange of hidden chambers, revenge, bloody violence, a torrential rainstorm, people hiding under beds, and any other mayhem that may come to mind. To be clear, Parasite can be very funny and some of the satire is sharp-edged, yet it is hardly, as one critic described it, ""a masterful dissection of social inequality."" When asked what he wanted viewers to get out of the film, Bong said, ""I just hope that it gives audiences a lot to think about. It is in parts funny, frightening, and sad, and if it makes viewers feel like sharing a drink and talking over all the ideas they had while watching it, I'll wish for nothing more."" Enjoy the drink. In a little while, you may have trouble remembering what the film was about."
20. Parasite,6/10,"Started off great, then tanked - and I get the message","This film is either a love or hate review. I get that most that hate it maybe didn't understand the message - I did, but it was written in a mind-boggling illogical plot-hole ridden way. What makes it even worse, is how great it was from the start, that when the ridiculousness kicked in, you become extremely disappointed. There are so many ways this could've been written much better - and still get the message across, and maintain the initial theme without tanking. Directing and cinematography were excellent, and the casting on point. And the 132 min runtime was flying by, until the plot started to tank. Clearly over-hyped and not worth anything more than my 6/10

20. Parasite,9/10,It's so metaphorical,
21. Alien,10/10,Holds up as a classic.,"Alien remains one of the most original, terrifying movies of all time. Compare this with the lame sci fi horrors we get nowadays, 1979, and it still packs a huge punch.

Fantastically atmospheric, chilling and terrifying even now, the story holds up incredibly well. The special effects were incredible for the time, no wonder the franchise is still in demand, though sadly nowhere near the quality of this one or its amazing successor.

The music is fantastic, the direction is incredible, and as for the Alien itself, way ahead of its time. Weaver is phenomenal, but arguably she's upstaged by the creature.

You can't help but remember scenes days after watching it, it definitely has the chill factor.

A cinematic masterpiece. 10/10"
21. Alien,10/10,A Timeless Science Fiction Masterpiece,"'Alien' is one of those special films that have aged very, very well. Even now, after nearly 40 years, everything about it just feels fresh. The restrained, natural performances by the fantastic cast; the outstanding production design; the beautiful, ominous score by Jerry Goldsmith; the realistic, ""lived-in"" look of space-freighter Nostromo's interior: it actually feels less dated than many science fiction films that were made much later, which is quite an astonishing feat. Even the (what now must be considered) ""retro"" technology inside the ship doesn't necessarily have to be viewed as anachronistic in the face of our obvious recent advancements, because it's the most simple technological equipment that is usually robust enough to survive the longest under harsh conditions (like the extreme temperatures in space).

I feel it's especially hard for science fiction films to stand the test of time - which is kind of inherent to the genre I suppose - and 'Alien' simply remains an outstanding achievement in that regard. It's a testament to the talent of everyone involved, but especially to the vision of director Ridley Scott. The film was crafted with so much love for every little detail, and the designs by Moebius, Chris Foss - and in particular the Lovecraftian horrors unleashed by Swiss surrealist H.R. Giger - are among the best and most iconic in any science fiction film. This isn't just an outstanding, timeless piece of entertainment: it's a work of art. 10 Stars out of 10.

21. Alien,10/10,One of the best classic sci-fi horror films of all time - A masterpiece,
21. Alien,9/10,The facehugger scared me as a kid and i still find em creepy.,"Everything has already been said about this great film n there seems to be little left to say but lemme contribute a lil more by praising how good this film is.

I first saw this in the late 80s on a vhs n as a kid i found it to be a bit slow but was shaken by the chestburster scene.

The facehugger terrified me as a kid.

Revisited all the four parts in the early 2k on dvds which i own.

Revisited this part again few days back as i am on Alien movie marathon n very impatient to check out Prometheus n Covenant.

I feel that this part is inspired by Bava's Planet of the Vampires.

The ruins with the skeletal remains, the design and shots of the ship itself does have the deja vu effect.

This one is atmospheric n dark, gory at times, it has enuff stuff for sci fi fans, it also has slasher n war like tone.

But the best thing is the feminist tone where in this part the women are not being cast as the helpless victims."

21. Alien,10/10,Undeniably stunning,"This was made in the seventies. Seventies. The picture quality is stunning. Undeniably stunning. The sound is perfect except minor issues regarding occasional muffled dialogue. God it looks good. Rivals and beats many films made thirty years later. The blend of suspense, horror, science-fiction is perfect. The budget is perfectly used. Perfect. I say stick with the theatrical version, the various director cuts are not as well paced, add irrelevant scenes and don't fix the one bit that annoys me - the jump cut on Ash's head. Stay theatrical and think of the best film ever made and you would possibly have this. There may be a scant few other films but this would be the first. The ending is so intense and fearful without cheap techniques. I love it. Very minor technical issues are forgotten through fear, fascination and legacy.

21. Alien,10/10,Classic tale of terror,"This is one of the finest science fiction films ever made. Everything is so carefully and expertly constructed to the point that repeated viewings are just as good as the first. Also, the atmosphere, along with the amazing sets, is real shocker and few movies have managed to create the same kind eerie feeling.

The story starts with the crew of the cargo vessel ""Nostromo"" waking up before schedule. They soon realize their on-board computer has detected life on a nearby planet and they go to investigate. One of them unwillingly brings back an...ALIEN (!) which soon becomes a very unwanted passenger. The introduction of the title creature in the famous chest-burster scene is a real jolter. Especially if you watch it after dinner.

The music, too, must be mentioned and it moves the story along with unrelenting terror. However, the lack of music, in certain scenes, works just as well and this combination makes for one of the best musical montages to be put on film.

This is a classic film that spawned a series, which is good overall, and a bunch of copycats, many of which are just sad. ""Alien"" came first and it is easily one the best. 10/10

Rated R: violence/gore and profanity"
21. Alien,10/10,Sci-Fi Masterpiece,"Not only is Alien one of the greatest sci-fi films created, it is undoubtedly encapsulates all the best elements of the horror genre too.

The plot is perfect. Simple enough that missed dialogue doesn't throw the audience out of the loop, yet complex enough to demonstrate the depth behind the context. Twists are utilised at the perfect moments to ensure that intrigue remains at a high while tension is at a constant. Characters superb, with no real stereotypes of tokenism added in to no effect.

Visually, the 1979 release is still far more aesthetic than films released 40 years later. The sets are superb, costuming is great, and the lighting to capture the right atmosphere is perfect. Brief glimpses of the Xenomorph establish the fearsome foe without putting everything on show and lessening it's impact, and is a perfect example of why costuming and puppetry done right will always look better than CGI.

An excellent cast, with Weaver's breakout role supported by the likes of Hurt and Holm. Dialogue is delivered realistically and always at the right intensity, and never out-of-step with the perfect directorial pacing.

A phenomenal start to clear franchise material, which no matter how wayward later editions go, will always be a classic. Somehow Alien's sequel matches this performance too."
21. Alien,9/10,Prophetic & Visionary...,"Allegorically and quite unintentionally a tale of a virus, ignorantly released its only aim is to destroy us, the wheels set in motion, a search begins for a new potion, but perpetuation has begun and there's absolutely nowhere you can run - from the evolutionary transformations, variations and mutations, the prequels, sequels and unequals yet to come.

21. Alien,10/10,Whose idea was it to bring a cat in the first place?,
21. Alien,9/10,"""Alien"" is not just the monster, it's the atmosphere and the way you feel!","In ""Alien"" we follow a seven man crew en-route to earth on board the huge space freighter ""Nostromo"". The crew is in cryosleep, but the on board computer interrupts the journey when a foreign radio signal is picked up. It originates from an uninhabited planet and the crew lands to investigate. There they make contact with an alien life-form...

What makes Alien so great is the constant feel of uneasiness. Right from the beginning you have a feeling that something is wrong. The crew is not particularly friendly towards each other, and you truly feel all the in-group tension. The ship itself is a huge worn out industrial-style maze of halls and corridors, and it feels more like a prison than a place to live. It is as if not only the alien but also the ship itself is against the humans. The Alien itself is the scariest monster in history because it is a ruthless, soul-less parasite completely devoid of any human or civilized traits. The design of the monster is a stroke of genius. Sure it has a humanoid form, but it has no facial traits or anything else which could give away emotions or intentions. Its actions reveals no weaknesses nor civilized intelligence. The Alien is more or less the opposite of everything human and civilized, plus the creature is more well-adapted to the inhumane interior of the ship than the humans who build it. To sum up, you then have a setting where the humans are caught in a web of in-group tensions, an inhospitable ship and the perfect killer which thrives in the ships intestines. You almost get the feel that the humans are the ones who are alienated to each other and to their own ship.

Ridley Scott tells the story with a perfectly synchronized blend of visuals and sounds.

The actors do a superb job, portraying their characters in a subtle but very realistic way. The seven man crew is not a bunch of Hollywood heroes. They are ordinary people with strengths and weaknesses, likes and dislikes. In this way they all seem so fragile when confronted with the enemy.

As mentioned the ship is very claustrophobic and Ridley Scott adds to the eeriness by using camera movement, lights and shadows in an effective way. The living quarters are bright and should be comfortable to the crew, but there is something sterile about it all. The rest of the ship is basically a huge basement.

The music by Jerry Goldsmith underlines the eeriness so well, and the movie wouldn't have worked without his score. Combined with the sounds of the ship it all adds to the uneasiness.

This is not a story about heroic people who boldly teams up against evil. It's a story about ordinary people facing true fear, which is the fear without a face. The fear we can't understand and can't negotiate with, because its only goal is to survive on the expense of us. It's a story where some people bravely fight back whilst others are destroyed by the terror. It's a story where people a killed in a completely random way. There is no higher-order justice behind who gets to live and who dies. All seven characters are just part of a race where the fittest - not necessarily the most righteous - will prevail, and all seven characters start the race on an equal footing. None of them are true heroes, and none of them are true villains.

All the above makes Alien so great as a horror movie. The terror isn't just the Alien itself, it's the entire atmosphere which gets so effectively under your skin, that you just can't shrug it off after the end credits like you can with so many other Hollywood horror movies. The title ""Alien"" doesn't just refer to the monster, it is the theme of the movie and it is the feeling you have during and after the movie. 9/10"
21. Alien,10/10,Alien.....the one that started it all........,"Alien....the creature......the film.....the legend. The one that started it all, the one that led to one of the greatest sequels ever made, one that got a comic book mini-series and 2 cross-over films with ""Predator"". This is THE film. And without a doubt, the greatest horror film ever created, and this totally makes ""Halloween"" look like ""Chicken Little"". You can forget about all those rubbish ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies, 'cause ""Alien"" just takes horror up to so many levels! In ""Alien"", we find ourselves in the distant future with a crew just coming back from a haul of 20 million tons of ore back to Earth. But while the crew members are in stasis, their ship picks up an ""SOS"" from a nearby planet, and once the crew is awakened, they are forced by the ""Company"" regulations to follow that signal. And then when they land on the planet and it turns out that something terrifying is in store for them, when a hostile organism attaches itself to one of the crew members. And later on, it becomes clear that the crew member was being impregnated and then dies a horrible, violent death from a deadly breed of an other-worldly life-form. And now the rest of the crew must fight off the creature.

As other classic films should always have, ""Alien"" does great on the characters. And of course, the most recognizable one is the lead woman, Ellen Ripley who is played then-unknown Sigourney Weaver. She provides a very human face and you're gonna feel like you're actually watching a real-life woman in here, and it could be because of her accent, or her mannerisms. But as the film progresses, she develops into a more mentally tougher woman while combating the Alien. There are times when she totally keeps it cool, times when she's afraid, times when she's angry, and times when its just Ripley being Ripley. And thanks to Weavers acting talents, she can really dish out one hell of a character.

The rest of the supporting cast are nothing short of spectacular, Parker and Brett are the selfish, sarcastic men who only want to make a profit. And through most of the film, you can feel the tension that Ripley and Parker have. Lambert, who one of my favorites from here is the second woman who happens to be the opposite of Ripley, a total coward. Dallas, who the viewer might get the vibe that HE is the main character in the 1st 15 minutes or so, is pretty much the leader here. Kane, is the tired, dead-looking guy who is the one that carries the alien species inside of him. And finally, Ash is the one with the sinister purpose and you start to suspect that he's up to no good at some point. And movie characters need to have their own personalities and that's what ""Alien"" has.

And as for the Alien itself, well what can i say? It is the most horrifying creature in the history of cinema, period. I mean, how could you stop it? It has acid for blood, and is very lethal to fight face-to-face. And the special effects were over 20 years ahead of its time. The face-hugger on Kane looked so freaking real, that you're gonna be scared just by looking at it, even it doesn't do anything except breathe most of the time. And the sets couldn't have been better, very futuristic, yet there's always something ominous and dark about them.

The suspense is impossible to resist as the sequences deliver the chills at times when you least expect it, and when you do expect something to happen, nothing happens. And ""Alien"" is one of the very few horror films that understands that you can't scare people by raking up the bodies and the blood, but you have to build up the suspense to do it. And director Ridley Scott is such a genius, and he shows that here, he absolutely knows how to make any kind of film, ones that can scare (Alien), one that can sadden (Thelma and Louise), and one that can excite/thrill (Gladiator). And Ridley really keeps up the dark atmosphere, especially in the beginning when there's no talking for the 1st 5 minutes or so, we get the feeling that something's not right all the time. Some parts are very quiet and very depressing and we feel exactly what we see.

This is the legend that I'm talking about here, folks. Don't miss the chance to see this, because it will scare the living daylights outta you more than any other movie you're gonna see in your life. Take my word for it....I'm practically a movie buff, so I know what I'm talking about...."
21. Alien,10/10,The mother of all movies,"Back in early 20th century, Lumière brothers didn't have a clue of what they were playing with. I'm freaking sure that if somebody could have magically told them that thanks to their work, a movie like 'Alien' would have been made in the future, they both would have died of a sudden, shocked by the consequences of their labor, like an honest scientist would if he was shown an evil use of his research. In that sense, but in the best way imaginable, 'Alien' is the atomic bomb.

In my opinion, 'Alien' is the only perfect movie in the history of cinema. Of course, this could be debatable, but of all the films I've watched since I was born, this is the only one in which I haven't been able to find the slightest flaw. It gets a golden ten out of ten. Bright, solid and massive.

I could go on with a panegyric, but I'll try to be short and accurate:

The direction is just perfect. Every shot is marvellous, every movement of the camera is breathtaking. There is absolutely nothing you could add or subtract. Touch it, and you spoil it. Seriously.

The acting is splendid. The performances build a credible world centuries away. I don't know about you, but this take on the future was unveliabably acceptable. Sigourney Weaver is more than a revelation, John Hurt is a master, and the rest are nothing short of marvellous.

The script is a work of art, the story is mesmerizing, well-constructed, well-developed, and free of absurd twists. Its simplicity and efectiveness are yet, 25 years after, to be matched.

The atmosphere is pure genius. Gothic, claustrophobic and sometimes baroque. The use of light and dark is beyond description, the use of sound is as creepy as it gets.

The FX are the best possible for 1979. In the time of the release, some scenes were stomach churning.

The score. Jerry Goldsmith's work matches the images so perfectly it seems to bleed from them. It is and will be the best soundtrack for a sci-fi flick in space ever.

The tagline. ""In space, no one can hear you scream"". THIS is a tagline.

And, of course... the alien. The only alive creature that can steal Weaver the movie. Its design is the most innovative I've seen. It has spawned dozens of disgraceful imitations. This is the real deal. Not only the look, but the complete design of a life form, including biological features. Acid instead of blood. Jaws inside jaws. What more could you possibly want? This is how a movie is done.

A very good sign of a movie that has gone down in history is the amount of collectively well remembered scenes. Well, 'Alien' has so many that I won't go into it. This movie contains so many iconic scenes that has become an icon itself.

So, what else? I urge all young directors to watch this movie a zillion times, as I've already done, and take notes all along. But not in order to rip off from it, as many others have done, but to learn, learn, learn, learn and learn how a movie should be done. 'Casablanca'? You must be joking.

Oh, I almost forget! There's a lovable cat in it.

RATING: 10"
21. Alien,10/10,An All-Time Classic,"""Alien"" is the one of the first films that I think of when I think of the word ""atmosphere."" Ridley Scott brilliantly crafts a setting in this sci-fi horror classic that is still explored with prequels and sequels. It's not just the setting though; it's the way that the plot slowly builds up and there are many moments of downtime to get a little familiar with characters. This film, along with other late 70s classics such as ""Halloween"", really set up the blueprint that most modern horror films replicate.

This movie is a marvel on a photographic level, with much of the shot composition and lighting and set design really making for a dark and claustrophobic experience. The idea of a huge 7 foot tall monster with acidic blood and a retractable mouth-within-a-mouth that hunts the crew members off one by one is a horrifying thought.

Much props has to be given to Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. This was a breakout role for her, and it's a role that she further explores and brings even more perfection to in the sequel. Most of the other characters aren't really worth mentioning other than Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) who I found extremely obnoxious and annoying (I can tell that this was probably Ridley Scott's intent with the character though). I also really liked Yaphet Lotto's character, Parker. No nonsense.

This is a must watch. Many classic horror movie tropes were spawned from this one. And with decades past it's still extremely elusive to track down, much like its eponymous alien."
21. Alien,10/10,EXTRA(ordinary)-TERR(ifying)-ESTRIAL,"One of the best lit films of all time, the attention and care towards how the sets, actors, and Xenomorph appear in darkness and light is so commendable and is what keeps this film looking so fresh. Alien is basically what happens when a creative team is given the ability to build an immersive world while also making a tense horror movie about an alien killing people on a ship. It has indulgent landing and launching sequences, an infatuation with the anatomy of its creature, accurate specs of its ships layout, it's not a hard sci-fi watch per se but you can tell if Ridley and the crew had more money this film would probably be much longer. As it is I think it has the perfect length, also huge props to that fantastic cast where every character is clear and well motivated. I love this movie so much.

21. Alien,10/10,A new level for Sci-fi Horror,"An alien distress call from an uncharted planet awaken the crew of the deep space towing vessel Nostromo. They go down to the planet to investigate only to bring back something dangerous.

The story is a fairly simple creature feature in a spaceship. Ridley Scott took that simple story and gave it everything needed to make a new standard in sci-fi horror. Before it the sci-fi horror is the mainstay of B-movie schlock. After it the genre reach a new golden age. The same way that Star Wars pushed the envelope, the same can be said of Alien.

The atmosphere is fantastic. Ridley Scott has packed in some iconic scenes. Who can forget the meal scene? It's going down in movie history. That are some movies that transcend a simple movie. This is one of them.

21. Alien,10/10,"For me, it doesn't get any better than this","I'm often amazed that people prefer Aliens to the original, I guess it's down to personal taste but in my opinion the first film is far and away the best. It's the way Ripley's whole world just unravels gradually from the get go, the pacing is sublime and it simply doesn't have to rely on tons of action set pieces like the second film does. My assumption is some people find it too slow but everytime I watch it I just marvel at every scene, the effort that went into every detail. The true mark of what an achievement this film was for the time is also how nothing appears dated even now in HD or in 4k, there are countless instances in the second film where it's blatantly obvious scale models have been used and it always bugs me. You have to remember this was made when Christopher Reeve's Superman was about which vfx's look terrible in comparison, blows your mind doesn't it?! Don't get me wrong I enjoy all of the Alien franchise movies, they do gradually worsen in sequence apart from Prometheus which is joint second place for me. I won't go into script or acting, needless to say both are top drawer and feel completely authentic and natural.

A masterpiece! Simple as that."
21. Alien,9/10,The start of a great anthology,
22. Se7en,9/10,Very grim and disturbing but you can't stop watching,"Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is about to retire. He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills (Brad Pitt). Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M.O. Meanwhile Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed.

Dark and depressing but just fascinating. Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.

If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting."
22. Se7en,10/10,"A brilliant postmodern film noir that is grim, intelligent and disturbing","From David Fincher, Se7en is a compelling and brilliant postmodern film noir. It is grim and disturbing but it is also very intelligent and daring. What I did love about Se7en especially is that it is incredibly stylish, beautiful dark cinematography and dazzling landscapes really do add to the atmosphere. Very little of the murders are shown but we are appalled and shocked by what we hear of them, the action is tense and the climax is shattering. There is also an intelligent screenplay, a clever plot telling of a vicious serial killer who murders his victims in a gruesome way to atone for the sins(gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath)he deems them to have committed and excellent direction. The acting is also superb, Morgan Freeman gives another brilliant performance as the disillusioned detective and Brad Pitt is great as Mills in a more meatier role than he has ever done. Gwyneth Paltrow makes a small yet significant appearance as Mill's uneasy wife, while Kevin Spacey superbly delivers equally superb dialogue as John Doe despite the fact he isn't in the film much. Overall, a brilliant film, with adept performances, direction, style and ambition. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
22. Se7en,10/10,Dark and disturbing thriller that will stay with you for ever.,"Rarely there has been a movie with such a good dark and chilling atmosphere. I even see this movie more as an horror movie than as a thriller because of that. ""Se7en"" is unique in many ways. The movies mood is already set right from the beginning on. The movie starts dark, intense, chilling and mysterious, a mood that is present throughout the entire movie. It's very depressing to watch and I mean that in a positive way of the meaning of the word. The mood is set by good camera work and lighting, or better said, the lack of it. The music from acclaimed composer Howard Shore also adds to the chilling atmosphere. Unlike many other movies from the same genre, the movie is slow paced and takes it time to develop the characters without falling into some obvious cliché's. The two main characters played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are presented as an unlikely police-couple that are different in many ways from each other but in a way that is also what makes them such a great couple. Brad Pitt for once has the opportunity to play more than just the pretty boy and he does it with success. Kevin Spacey truly plays a bone chilling character, almost just as legendary and chilling as Hannibal Lecter. I would very much like to see the two of them put in the same room, just to see who would make it out alive. Further more it was great to see R. Lee Emrey again as the police captain. The movie is filled with some truly gross, sickening and horrifying scene's, this seriously ain't no kids stuff! The movie has some of the most sickening murders I have ever seen featured in a movie. But it aren't just only the gross scene's that are good, there are also some scene's that are made with lot's of beauty and profession such as the library scene. Dark and chilling movie that you will never forget also thanks to the ending which I will not spoil for you. A real must see. 10/10"
22. Se7en,10/10,Still manages to astound after 20 years of repeat viewings,"After his calamitous experience working on his début film Alien 3 (1992), David Fincher took on a small genre picture that, little did he know, would revitalise his career and become one of the greatest films of the 1990's. Se7en appears to begin as your typical detective neo- noir, with the cynical veteran and the naive rookie taking on an elusive serial killer seemed hell-bent on turning the sin against the sinner. But, set in an unnamed and permanently drizzly American city, Se7en is a meditation on evil and a pessimist's depiction on the modern world, climaxing in one of the bravest and most memorable endings in Hollywood history.

Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is on the verge of retirement, where he plans to leave his inner-city life behind him after years of fighting on the side of good. His replacement is the brash Detective Mills (Brad Pitt), an optimistic young recruit eager to learn, who Somerset takes under his wing. Their first homicide investigation involves an obese man who has been fed at gunpoint to the point of causing his stomach to rupture. With Somerset ready to leave the force, Mills takes on his first solo case in the murder of a rich attorney, a man forced to cut a pound of flesh from his own body. The murder scene has the words 'greed' written in blood. Somerset eventually finds the word 'gluttony' etched in grease in the apartment of the first victim, and he becomes convinced the murders are connected, and that the killer is murdering under the guidance of the seven deadly sins.

The genius of Se7en is rooted in the way the movie keeps the audience as clueless as the detectives. Normally in genre pictures such as this, we either know who the killer is and eagerly wait for the investigators to put the pieces together, or we have a line-up of suspects and red herrings to decide from. Here, apart from brief glimpses during a thrilling chase scene, we are devoid of clues. The killer is always one step ahead of Somerset and Mills, alluding to the idea that the mysterious 'John Doe' is indeed having his work guided by a higher power. Of course, he is not, he is merely a man, but this helps gives Se7en dramatic weight, rather than it becoming a nihilistic exercise in cruelty.

When, three-quarters of the movie in, the killer hands himself in, the movie becomes a masterclass in writing, slowly building into one of the greatest climaxes in film. Somerset, a decent man who has devoted his life to the side of good but has had the fight slowly drained out of him, meets his nemesis in John Doe (Kevin Spacey). But as they talk, Doe's reasoning becomes clear and, shockingly, almost sympathetic. ""Wanting people to listen, you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore, you have to hit them with a sledgehammer,"" he says. It's about a world gone to s**t, a view shared by Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), who talks to Somerset in a diner about allowing a baby to be born into the world after discovering she is pregnant. Cerebral and Gothic, Se7en transcends the genre on so many levels thanks to some bleak yet stylish direction by Fincher, and it still manages to astound after almost 20 years of repeat viewings.

22. Se7en,10/10,An out and out classic.,"A retiring Detective and a young rookie are hunting down a serial killer, a killer with a dark MO, murdering his victims using the seven deadly sins.

As I watch this, it's coming up to its thirtieth anniversary, and it's as fresh now as it was back in 1995, it's an intensely macabre take, crimes that are infinitely macabre and depraved, and intensely twisted.

The combination of Freeman and Pitt is incredible, they work immensely well together, we have the fresh zest of Mills, and the unshakable, but battle weary Somerset. Paltrow and Spacey are excellent in support.

Two hours flashed past, there is no lull, no moment to switch off and boil the kettle, the intensity is immediate, the pacing designed to keep you glued.

I have always thought there is a shade of Alfred Hitchcock about this movie, such is the intelligence of the plot.

Very good visuals, the macabre and gruesome bodies look shocking still, nothing is spared or hidden away.

10/10."
22. Se7en,10/10,Probably the greatest murder story ever,"Seven's quality puts it so far beyond most of the ""cops on trail of deranged killer"" genre that it comes out as a true jewel of cinema. Everything about seven is perfect. It is art captured on film. This movie is a bright spot for all of the stars who worked on it.

Brad Pitt never gets the credit he deserves for his acting because he's a pretty boy and the press is a lot more interested about how he and Jennifer are doing. That's a shame because he is a talented actor that isn't afraid to take chances with both the roles that he picks and the characters that he plays. That is quite rare in the A-list world. Morgan Freeman is a great actor. You can always count on him to do what he does best which is play a wise veteran that has seen it all. Kevin Spacey is another great actor that has great range and really puts life and personality into his characters.

The real talent of this movie, excluding the actors that brought it to life, is the director David Fincher and the writer Andrew Kevin Walker. Fincher's talents for making a visually stunning film are now well known and he often brings a dark patina to his work. Andrew Kevin Walker must have some incredible demons living inside him. Either that or one hell of an imagination for bringing the intricate story of Seven and the plan of John Doe to life.

John Doe's plan really is twisted and I won't be spoiling it here. Suffice to say I have never seen so evil and complicated a plan in a movie before or since. The cinematography of the film is dark but beautiful and throughout the film it is either night or raining or both except for two very brief moments. It is such an emotional movie that you can't keep from being caught up in what is happening. Do you understand and sympathize with what John Doe is doing or do you think him a mad killer that must be stopped.

Bottom Line: If you haven't had the opportunity to see Seven yet then you must at least rent it. It is so damn good that I know you will like it. The only reason you wouldn't is because you're just too damn fragile to take something this hardcore."
22. Se7en,10/10,A dark and disturbing masterpiece.,
22. Se7en,9/10,one of the best-made films of its era and genre,"Despite clichés, and a very depressing finale, this is one of the best-made films of its era and genre.

The strengths of the film include an odd relationship between the two lead cops, who seem loosely based on the two lead cops of the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, but who (thankfully) never play for laughs, and never really become ""buddies"" - the young cop is too arrogant, and the older cop has too much experience, which the young cop refuses to acknowledge. The two characters are also brilliantly acted by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt (probably his best performance).

There's one odd flaw in the film - about half-way through, I found that I had learned to ""expect the unexpected"" from the film, which meant that the rest of the film was predictable in a bizarre way - simply decide where the expected move would be, and then expect the unexpected move instead. The most obvious instance of this is in the finale itself, which could be guessed at least 5 minutes ahead of time.

Normally, this would be a formula for disaster - but fortunately, the high quality of the film-making twists the film into an edge-of-the-seat suspenseful waiting game as we watch with horror the one cop's encounter with the insanity of pure evil.

I didn't want to admire this film (to be honest, I dislike Brad Pitt something fierce), but I'm afraid I must - very professionally made, it delivers its promised suspense all the way."
22. Se7en,10/10,Top Serial Killer Movie,
22. Se7en,10/10,Modern Masterpiece!!,"Gothic, shocking, suspenseful, disturbing and clever, `Seven' marked a new beginning for director David Fincher's career. This dark tale of murder and crime revolves around two detectives in present New York city played by two brilliant actors `Brad Pitt' and `Morgan Freeman' who are paired together to solve a puzzle of murder that is at the hands of a man who kills regarding to the seven deadly sins. Both actors displayed striking performances that are so sharp and realistic sometimes you have to remind yourself that's its all acting.

David Fincher's masterpiece really gives us an opportunity of a lifetime, maybe it's one that we don't all wish to share, but by seeing this movie you will experience a glimpse of the horrors that this world is filled with, and a small piece of mind of a man who you only prey you never have to meet.

Brad Pitt successfully proves to us that he's not just a pretty face on screen, and that he sinks into his character so well, that you can walk off after the film finishes classifying him as a pretty darn good actor.

You wouldn't expect anything else from Morgan Freeman because it's perfectly obvious that this guy was born to play the roles of the smart detective.

David Fincher's timeless directing and memorable filming captures all the goods that this film has to offer and will undoubtedly leave you shocked and begging for more films like this. Seven is a step into the harsh realities of life, a realistic portrayal of two detectives investigation into the un-describable horrific world murder, and the darkest realms of the human soul.

We can only prey for more classic memorable work from Mr. Fincher and for those future directors who are intent on making a gothic, psychological thriller, make sure you sit down and watch Seven with a pen and paper ready to take notes."
22. Se7en,10/10,Stand out Thriller thanks to Fine Cast.,
22. Se7en,9/10,"David Fincher Strikes Again, With An Unwavering Thriller That Strikes Straight To The Heart","Pros: 1. The score is beautifully ominous which only deepens the thrilling and unsettling atmosphere. 2. Brad Pitt (Mills), Morgan Freeman (Somerset), and Kevin Spacey (John Doe) give amazing performances. 3. The colour palette being dark and monotone helps to cement the gloomy and grim tone. 4. The gore and practical effects are immense and they still stand up 25 years later. The sloth, lust, and gluttony murders, in particular, stick in mind. 5. The great cinematography knows when to pull the camera back, as well as to draw it close for great effect. 6. Both Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt have great chemistry together. 7. The back-and-forth between Somerset, Mills, and John Doe in the police car is one of the most intense and captivating scenes in the history of cinema. 8. The movie presents the interesting and complex moral quandary of: is it immoral to kill the immoral? Even if those immoral people adversely affect other people? And who gets to decide who is immoral, and what punishment should be meted out to them? 9. Despite the underdeveloped character of Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), the conclusion is still one of the hardest hitting and iconic endings ever created.

Cons: 1. Tracy is a severely underdeveloped character, with her pregnancy-confessing scene to Somerset feeling lazily forced to add weight to the final scene."

'Se7en' Synopsis: Two detectives, a rookie and a veteran, hunt a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his modus operandi.

'Se7en' is a Masterstroke from start to end. A dark, moody, violent & utterly gripping story, that keeps you at the edge-of-your-seat. There isn't a single dull moment in this blockbuster, in fact, the tale gets more & more intriguing as it progresses.

Andrew Kevin Walker's Screenplay is Ace. It's a spine-chilling tale about two heroes out to get a psychotic killer. The Writing grips you from the moment it begins & refuses to let you go. Fincher's Direction is incredible. The way he has handled this twisted story, deserves an ovation. Darius Khondji's Cinematography is flawlessly done. Richard Francis-Bruce's Editing is tight. Action-Sequences are mind-blowing. Howard Shore's Score is perfect.

Performance-Wise: Morgan Freeman is at his understated best. The Oscar-Winning Legend delivers a master-class act here, that ranks amongst his finest to date. Brad Pitt is in terrific form, adding depth & anger to his part. Kevin Spacey is loathsome to the core in his creepy portrayal of the wicked villain. Gwyneth Paltrow is wonderful in a brief, yet important role.

22. Se7en,10/10,Se7en is a Sinfully Enthralling Thriller!,"Se7en is a nerve-jangling thriller, hauntingly shot by visionary director David Fincher, who crafts one of the most iconic films of all time.

Se7en tells the tale of a grisly serial killer who is twisted on delivering a sermon against modern depravity. He murders his victims to atone for the sins he deems them to have committed; his crimes echo the seven deadly sins namely gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, pride, wrath and lust. Tracking this gruesome killer (played with a quiet insanity that makes your flesh crawl, by an actor par excellence – no spoilers here!) is a cliché pair of cops. There's the jaded veteran Detective Lieutenant Somerset (Morgan Freeman who brings great depth and dignity to the part) who is in the last week of his employ with the police department. Partnering him is a young, eager-to-kick-some-evil-butt cop Detective Mills (Brad Pitt whose callowness works perfectly for his character). After killing an overweight man by force-feeding him to death in the name of gluttony and bleeding to death a lawyer for greed, the anonymous killer is now turning his attention to the five remaining deadly sins. As the two men investigate, the gulf between their respective world-views begins to inform everything about how they respond to the savagery of these crimes.

It is impossible to deny the potency and artistry with which Fincher executes the material. Although very little of each murder is shown, the director expertly allows suggestion to lead the appalled viewer towards the truly cataclysmic climax. Fincher's sepia-toned gloom successfully lends the film the knock-out punch it intends to. Purposely draining his landscapes of color, and setting all the tense action against rain-washed streets and under-lit interiors, Fincher evokes an atmosphere of nightmarish proportions as he unfolds a gripping tale of urban horror.

Se7en is riveting in a gut-twisting way. It plays out at an engaging pace destined to entrance you with its abject horror. The film is as dark and brutal as a film can be, without showing much actual violence. Most of the stuff in the film is implied, but it's so damn disturbing that you feel like you actually saw it. And that is the beauty of Se7en!"
22. Se7en,10/10,Fincher's Se7en is a classic crime story which can rival the likes of Silence of the Lambs,
22. Se7en,10/10,"Dark, grisly, and highly intelligent edge-of-your-seat thriller","David Fincher has been one of most thoughtful directors in Hollywood for many years, and his ingenious filmmaking all started in the mid- 1990s with this grim, but intelligently crafted psychological thriller. This film follows David Mills (played by Brad Pitt), a newly transferred police detective in an unnamed crime-ridden metropolitan city, who is partner with an old veteran detective William Somerset (played by Morgan Freeman) who is on the verge of retirement, to investigate a string of gruesome murders all around the city. These murders happen to correlate with the seven deadly sins which include: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy, and wrath. Mills and Somerset take in matters in their own hands to hunt down the sadistic serial killer (played by an actor who I'm gonna keep a secret) responsible for the grisly murders, only to be faced with a scarring truth about his intentions.

This David Fincher masterpiece is not a horror film, but it certainly sits directly at the borderline of one. Complete with eerie visuals and near non-stop suspense from start to finish, this film pulls audience into an unflinchingly grim atmosphere that leaves shivers down their spine and rarely lightens up. To add more to the dark tone, it rain in nearly every scene taking place outside to give them a more somber look. As the plot progresses, the audience are treated with nauseating afterviews of the serial killer's murder. But instead of having the camera linger over the gory details of the victims, we are giving heavy implications of how they particularly occurred. These scenes do just enough without the suspenseful music score to leave viewers at the edge of their seats. Then there is the serial killer himself who is portrayed as very sadistic, almost Lecter Hannibul-like, and creepy in appearance. His way of outwitting the main characters are quite shocking. The actor who plays him does an incredible job on his portrayal. As the story continues on, it builds up to one of the most haunting conclusions ever put to film, an ending that really pushes the boundaries. Ultimately, it works pretty well.

Se7en is one of the well-crafted and twisted thrillers I've ever seen and one of the spine-chilling films Hollywood has to offer, thanks to the incredible camera-work, brilliant direction by David Fincher and fantastic script by Andrew Kevin Walker. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman who play the main characters show amazing chemistry on screen together and their performances work pretty well. While the film is really great, it is definitely not recommended for the faint of heart."
22. Se7en,10/10,"""Se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever, making it one of the greatest films of the 90's""","The movie, ""Se7en"", starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow, is by far one of the most inventive, well-written, and cerebral films in recent history. The film, blending a well put together combination of dark visual style, intense plot development, and polished acting, remains tight and focused throughout, from beginning to end, never straying outwards into unimportant issues, or resorting to typical Hollywood clichés. Se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, David Fincher.

The story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer, who, inspired by Dante Alighieri's seven deadly sins from ""The Divine Comedy"", sets out to, ""preach"" about man's impurity, and does so by targeting victims, then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them. Se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story, however, it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth, with good and evil taking centre stage. The story is original on all counts, and thrilling on all levels. The most important aspect of Se7en, however, is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story, as oppose to other thrillers, which become predictable and bland by the end. By keeping the audience in the dark, the film remains fresh and original as it progresses. Se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point, just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere, thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved. By the film's conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at Se7en's surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring. Se7en's poetic ending(which will not be given away) says a lot for the people behind the movie, showing they are not afraid of going against the grain. A rarity with films so nowadays.

Directed brilliantly by David Fincher, and skillfully written by Andrew Kevin Walker, Se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever, making it one of the greatest films of the 90's. While Se7en may not have garnered critical acclaim as such films as Silence of the Lambs, Se7en is, undoubtedly, as influential as any film to date.

23. Schindler's List,10/10,Awesome,"The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.

Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.

I still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - ""Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people."""
23. Schindler's List,10/10,One of the best movies ever made.,"Businessman Oskar Schindler saved the lives of many Jews, by employing them in his factories, this saving them from going to The Concentration Camps.

This was, and will forever be, one of the best films ever made, not just the ultimate story of The Holocaust, but truly as masterpiece, one of the best.

If you can sit through it without being moved to the point of tears, you're made of stronger stuff than I am, the atrocities committed on those innocent people will never be forgotten. The realisation here is chilling.

The film's pacing is quite remarkable, it's a three hour film that flashes by quickly, but it's three hours that will live with you forever, some of the scenes will rightly never be forgotten.

What has always struck me, is the way that everything became normalised, people first losing their businesses, their homes, their freedom, and ultimately their lives, it is truly one of the bleakest points in human history, that's what this film details perfectly.

The Cinematography is incredible, it's understated, but perfect, fits the film perfectly, the sheer scale of it is so impressive. The scene with the little girl in the red coat has always been one of the standout moments.

No wonder it won a string of Oscars, the acting is outstanding throughout, I have always regarded this is Liam Neeson's best ever performance, but Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are remarkable also.

It's a film that informs, moves, and makes you think in equal measures. If you think it's going to be too much, I'd say this, it is very upsetting at times, but it does also give some real glimpses of hope, the remarkable human spirit.

A jaw dropping, powerful movie, it's one of the best ever made.

Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler's List did. Schindler's List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler's List did that to me. If you want to see the best depiction of the Holocaust, make your way towards Schindler's List. Me n my kids cried during the pit scene.

23. Schindler's List,10/10,You don't have to be Jewish to be touched by this response to inhumanity.,
23. Schindler's List,10/10,"Whoever saves one life, saves the world entirely. ⭐","As you may know there is lots of World War II movies. Some of them shows you the worst parts of war, this one is doing something better.

Shows you the war is bad for everyone. Shows you een the little kindness is the greatest thing. Shows you ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entirely.""

I saw so many World War II movies, non of them gave me these feelings. Most of them are just too sided with USA. Some of them just made with fictional characters. And I don't know how but some of them says war is a good thing if you're shooting bad people.

Besides one of the greatest historical Screenplay, the Acting Performances just superb. I don't imagine any better casting for any character. They all chosen well. With Liam Neeson's Schindler, Ben Kingsley's Stern and the great villain Ralp Fiennes' Amon Goth.

Scores is the soul of the movie. John Williams mades you feel that.

Cinematography is too great, watching this movie with these colors makes the movie too much realistic. I don't know how is it doing that. I know some of the movies are trying that when flashback scenes are coming, but most of them are not being successful at.

Art Direction and Set Decoration is also too varied. They managed to do an enormous job. You feel the greatness in the movie with varied places and objects."
23. Schindler's List,10/10,Spielberg's most important work,"Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic womanizing German businessman. He charms important Nazis, and gets access to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) as his right hand man, and Jewish money to pay for his business. He provides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous connections, he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to save people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler is able to befriend the mad commander.

This is probably the most important movie of director Steven Spielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on the true story, Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of the Holocaust is expertly done. When I first saw it in the theater, I couldn't help sob a little when Schindler breaks down at the end."
23. Schindler's List,9/10,What he hell is wrong with the people that commented on the 1st 4 pages of reviews???,
23. Schindler's List,10/10,Stunning; Spielberg's Greatest. Top 💯 All Time Best Films,"Leaves one speechless - Moving, somber, and horrifying. One of Humankind's worst moments - Something no one should ever forget. This is filmmaking at its finest. Even with 7 Oscars, deserved more. On par with the greatest films ever made. Certainly cemented Steven as one of the greatest filmmakers to walk the planet. A personal labor by Steven, it is clearly something he felt compelled to do, and it shows in the intricate detail of every scene. ""Schindler's List"" is nearly flawless in every category. A must-see film for reasons beyond entertainment.

23. Schindler's List,10/10,It's About Our Humanity,"We need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this movie. This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country."
23. Schindler's List,10/10,"Incredibly moving and visually disturbing, Spielburg's best by far!","Some of Schindler's List is very disturbing indeed, with very graphic images on the screen. I thought this film is outstanding. True, it is very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox.

23. Schindler's List,10/10,"""The list is an absolute good, the list is life...""",
23. Schindler's List,9/10,"Profound Beauty! If you appreciate art, this is a masterpiece.",
23. Schindler's List,10/10,Devastating,"The Holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. Many believed it never happened, despite meticulous records kept by the Nazis themselves. Those who lived through it were scarred forever, and even now can barely bring themselves to discuss its horrors. Despite the controversy around the event, there is one thing for certain, Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Schindler's List. It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself.

The film is in black and white, a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter, already disturbing, even more so bleak and harrowing. Oskar Schindler is known for saving thousands of Jews destined for a grim fate during World War 2. The movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal, with constant brutal oppression by Nazi camp guards and the sadistic Amon Goth, with a terrifying portrayal by Ralph Fiennes.

Yes, this film will not make you cheery or happy. Yes it is about a miserable and dark period in human history, but it is an important film to watch for anyone interested in this historic subject matter and also a beautiful work of art for film lovers. Truly one of Spielberg's finest works. The fact that he is Jewish himself does add a personal touch to the tragic tale, but he never tries to overdo the sympathy or antipathy towards any group in the film.

Everyone is human in this film, the Jews and the Nazis; the tragedy is that humanity itself failed during this period of history, and we will never forget."

23. Schindler's List,10/10,Amazing!,"This Movie was sensational. It was a piece of art along with being informational. It told people about the holocaust, and it also told people about the human spirit. It shows how people can just triumph over anything with just some help from one person The things that Spielberg did with the movie was incredible too. The black and white was genius, and how he had the little girl in red and the fire was phenuminal. I have never seen anything like it, Schindler's List is beyond all words.

24. American Beauty,10/10,Entertaining and Thought-Provoking.,
24. American Beauty,10/10,An Oscar well deserved.,"This film is one of a kind. After seeing this film last week, I was left with a hole in the pit of my stomach. It left many questions in my mind, and most of them cannot be answered. In my view, a film that makes me think after I watch it is second-to-none, and this film certainly delivers in that aspect.

I was amazed with the vivid imagery in this movie, as well as with the symbolism. However, what makes this film the best of 1999 is the acting. Kevin Spacey shines as Lester Burnham, and Annette Bening (Carolyn Burnham) isn't far behind. Supporting cast members such as Wes Bentley (Ricky Fitts), Thora Birch (Jane Burnham), Mena Suvari (Angela Hayes), and Chris Cooper (Col. Frank Fitts) only add to the drama of this film. I think the most special aspect of this film is how all of the characters intertwine in a way that is believable, yet fantastic at the same time. I congratulate Sam Mendes for his direction of this film, as well as Alan Ball for writing it. I don't think it could have been any better.

Rated R in the U.S. for strong sexuality, language, drug content, and violence, the film obviously deserves its rating. However, none of the causes for the R rating are overbearing, and all of them add to the plot-line of this film. While I don't think that this is a film for children, I would suggest that adults should view it with an open mind. I believe that the traits which many of the characters in this film have are found in many people around the world. Perhaps that is why this film hits close to home for so many viewers.

While billed by some as a ""comedy-drama"", I don't see anything about this film as funny. Sure, there are some comedic moments, but by the end, those moments were all but forgotten when faced with the grim reality of the conclusion of the events portrayed in this film.

If you want to watch a light-hearted film with some elements of comedy and some elements of drama, don't see American Beauty. But if you enjoy films that make you think, and are entertained by an excellent cast, excellent directing, and an excellent screenplay, this film should be at the top of your list.

My Rating: 10/10"
24. American Beauty,10/10,An American Masterpiece,"This is by far one of the best, if not THE, movies of the 90's. ""American Beauty"" stole my vote immediately as I started watching it. The idea and concept of ""American Beauty"" is just some ordinary people on an ordinary block with ordinary lives.

Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnam, a middle aged married man who has lost some hope in life. He has a job that is degrading, a wife who refuses to show any type of loving emotion towards him, a daughter who practically hates herself, and is judged constantly as a looser. But all of a sudden, he sees his daughter's friend, Angela, and something snaps in him to do something with his life. He quits his job and takes, the dreaded by most Americans, a fast food cook job. He starts working out and doing some illegal substances. Even though this sounds like he is ruining his life, it actually helps him and makes him realize how much he loves ""the precious moments in his stupid little life."" You have no idea what he is talking about I'm sure, but don't worry, you will some day. Kevin Spacey was by far the best actor in 1999 and deserved this Oscar 100%.

Annete Benning plays Carol Burnam, Lester's wife. She is a very fake and unsuccessful real estate agent who cannot get a sale. Her image in life is ""in order to be successful, one most project an image of success at all times"". You can tell, she is not happy with her marriage and starts to have an affair with the big boss of the real estate company. Again, seems horrible, but it helps her in the end. Annete was unfortunately robbed of an Oscar for this film.

The supporting cast: Thora Birtch who plays Janie, Lester and Carol's daughter, is extremely depressed and hates her body and herself. But when she notices a strange boy next door and develops a relationship with him, she realizes how precious life is and starts communicating with her family. Mena Suvari plays Angela, Janie's best friend, Lester's crush, and a girl who is clearly insecure despite her attempts at showing her sexy side to every guy in town. Wes Bentley plays Ricky, the next door neighbor boy who looks at something as simple as a bag being tossed in the wind as something beautiful. Some say that this was a very stupid scene, but I disagree. His dialog was perfect and made us look twice at something so simple. He won most of our hearts despite having somewhat of an arrogant attitude. Wes without a doubt got robbed of a nomination for this movie. Chris Cooper plays Ricky's father, Col. Frank Fits. He is a military Sergent who is very abusive to his wife and son and is an obvious homophobic that turns into an ironic situation in the end. Chris also should've been nominated.

The most stunning character actually to me was Allison Janney who played Barbara Fits, Ricky's mom, and Frank's wife. She was so beautiful and perfect. Her scene in the front room with Frank and Ricky, everything is so quite, and she says ""I'm sorry, what?"". Ricky says ""Mom, no one said anything"". When Ricky gets kicked out by Frank after a horrible accusation, Ricky says ""Mom, I'm leaving"". Instead of being like the average mom and trying to stop him or say things will get better, she knows this is best and says ""OK. Wear a raincoat"". Allison was just amazing and didn't get enough credit for her role.

If there could have been nominations for every role in this movie, they were well deserved. This is a terrific movie that should be watched by every adult. It'll make you look again at your life and think. What a great movie.

24. American Beauty,10/10,Beautiful...so beautiful,
24. American Beauty,10/10,"A deep, wonderful, penetrating film; extraordinary irony in a psychological drama about the American life.","I have come to see the movie with a certain prejudice. Everyone saying that it was so wonderful, so touching, so excited -- I usually tend to go with movies that nobody likes. Nevertheless, this one was a certain exception.

It is a wonderful psychological drama, a satire about the American community and about the American life; dark, painful irony and cynicism in the descriptions of life and characters; deep sarcasm on types of people in the community, habits of behaviour such as ""...if you want to succeed, you always have to seem successful..."" or ""never stop smiling"", parasites of the community, and, most importantly, the treatment of people who are ""different"", who are ""freaky"" to some extent; and eventually, there is no character in the film that is not odd in its way, although we have to wait for the very ending of the film, to discover this.

With very deep and accurate exaggeration, (most of) the characters in the movie demonstrate the worst, the darkest sides of their personality, while still remaining very human, very touching and very involving the observer. Everyone can find a certain similarity with characters and persons who he met in his life, in the characters described in the film. The tragi-comical events, the little pieces of funny, disturbing irony dripping from almost every episode, lead the observer to exploration of the American Beauty -- the beauty in life, and the way that we fail to find it, for all our life; the way we hide our feelings and emotions, even behind sullen walls of our sepulchre.

The acting is truly brilliant, the episodes are built logically, coherently, the dialogues are deep, thrilling, intriguing; every sentence and every word is deeply constructed, containing profound irony and intelligent elements of humors. The plot is very intelligently built, constructing a true indication of the sad situation of the American society, and an excellent ground for the actors.

An amazing movie, strongly recommended. 10/10"
24. American Beauty,10/10,A little masterpiece...,"""American Beauty"" is tour de force cinema. Sam Mendes' brilliant debut feature depicts a web of characters who yearn for their own 'American Dream' - yet, in the end, only one character truly attains it.

Having seen ""Happiness"" only recently, I could not help but draw comparisons: both films centre around a microcosm of society in which the people, in their own unique way, all strive to be successful or simply 'happy'. But here the similarities end: the characters in ""Happiness"" undergo a self-realisation process through which they become increasingly aware of their meaningless existence, and go on to wallow in their own depravity. ""Happiness"" shows no signs of redemption; whereas in ""American Beauty"" the audience is offered a sense of hope, of salvation, though the characters must endure a similar fate, or more accurately, they must endure the way of life in which they are trapped.

The pivotal character upon which this theme centres, is the father Lester, played impeccably by Kevin Spacey. He is presented to us as a bit of a loser who plays the subjugated figure in the home and at work. He appears resigned to an unhappy life in which he is treated badly by his wife and daughter and his boss at work. Seemingly beyond redemption, Lester transforms from being a loser.

Mendes portrays this transformation admirably well: he shows Lester on his 'path to enlightenment' pushed up against a grim background of suburbanite existence. These early scenes are well balanced, forming a steady rhythm of TV commercial-like vignettes which prove very comical, if at times unsettling. As Lester reflects in the film: ""My life is like a commercial"". And how this rings true: like in ""Happiness"", all the characters hide underneath this veneer of normality and respectability, yet they are all revealed to be nothing but the opposite: depressed, depraved and desperate.

Lester's wife, played by Annette Benning, is the most success-driven character in the story which renders her the most hopeless in the film's tone of moral conviction. ""In order to be successful in life one must project the appearance of success"" is the maxim she adopts from the 'king' of real estate, Buddy King. It is a phrase which resonates throughout the film: for Benning's pawn, life is all about keeping-up appearances. This is where Lester differs from her: his emancipation is enabled by him discarding the constraints of 'normal life' and following what his heart desires.

Lester is the catalyst in this narrative in which the ancillary characters either follow suit (as does his daughter and Ricky) or pay the price (as does his wife and the Colonel). The irony inherent in this film, and it grows with resonance as the film draws to a conclusion, is that the only character who truly becomes free must sacrifice everything in order to achieve it. Yet it is through his sacrifice that he is able to afford the surviving characters a glimpse of hope in life.

This film left me gasping for air: its hyper-realism conveys, at the same time, a portrait of the suburban comedy, a jolting-shock of realisation, and a cathartic sense of hope. Mendes depicts a certain people who, to varying degrees, all strive for a certain 'American Dream', yet so few actually attain it. Though whilst one may have difficulty with tagging this film with the 'feel good' label, the beauty of ""American Beauty"" is that it sits half-way between a desperate cry for help and a reassuring sense of happiness and fulfilment and that is cinema at its best."
24. American Beauty,10/10,Beautiful...,"Probably the best film of 1999. This dark comedy drama marks two fantastic feature film debuts with Alan Ball as writer and Sam Mendes as director (both winning oscars for their sterling efforts).

Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, a man on the brink of a mid-life crisis, who suddenly becomes obsessed with one of his teenage daughters friends played by Mena Suvari. His daughter (Thora Birch) is, as Lester tells us; ""a typical teenager. Angry, insecure, confused..."". And his wife Caroline (Annette Bening) has an obsession of her own, her public appearance.

Life starts off on a downer for the Burnhams and their new neighbours the Fitts despite their lives looking good from the outside.

As life begins to improve (with most of the main characters finding what they think is love or new relationships) it soon all comes crashing down in the climactic final day.

The writing is nothing short of brilliant and made even more amazing by knowing that it comes from a first time feature film screen writer Alan Ball (who had had years of prior experience writing TV sitcoms - not that you'd be able to guess from the tone of this film).

The directing is on a par with the writing and Sam Mendes manages to get some brilliant performances from the great cast, who are all faultless. No doubt Mendes' theatre directing past played a huge part in directing the actors so well.

Another person worthy of a mention is the late director of photography Conrad L. Hall, another one of the five oscar recipients for this film.

All the elements in this film gel perfectly together to make one superb masterpiece. Not one person, either cast or crew, steals this film or does anymore than anyone else to make this film what it is. Truly an ensemble effort. 10/10."
24. American Beauty,10/10,Close To Perfection,"The intention is so clear that everything else falls into place, perfectly. Kevin Spacey's suburban husband and father reminded me of his character in ""The Ref"" and that could only be a good thing. Annette Bening and her giggle works wonders here. Their marriage is a tabloid version of a ""Who's Afraid To Virginia Woolf"" Which means very close to someone we know. The biggest surprises in the film. besides the amazing dexterity of Sam Mendes at his first outing behind the camera, are West Bentley. Chris Cooper, Thora Brch and Allison Janney. As I'm writing this 8 years after its first release, the Oscars and the whole hullabaloo, I'm very surprised that West Bentley hasn't become a major star. He is amazing in ""American Beauty"" the complexities of his character are based on recognizable human stands, the hardest to face up to and I went where he went. Thora Birch is lovely as the object of his attention and the film, I believe, is here to say.

24. American Beauty,10/10,One of my faves of the year...simply great.,"This movie was a joy to watch. I didn't know what to expect when I came into it. I had heard the buzz of the acting and the story, etc...but we've all heard that before and had been disappointed, but not so with this one.

Kevin Spacey plays this part to a ""T"". He is strong when it requires and meek when it is needed. His emotional rollercoaster ride is a trip to partake in. Annette Bening is marvelous as well. I think they both should be nominated.

The support cast is also spectacular. Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari all give great performances as the troubled ""Teenagers"" in the film. Of particular mention is Wes Bentley's performance, worthy of a supporting nomination as well.

This is a dramatic and funny tale of a man and his life in a state of turmoil and transition. When he happens to see a beautiful friend of his daughter's at a cheerleading exhibition, he is completely infatuated with her beauty. Using this as his inspiration, he attempts to change all aspects of his life. He confronts his marriage, his job, his ego, and his libido.

The music in this film is also very well chosen. There are moments when the music fits so perfectly with the scene that they meld together as one to present a perfect emotion.

The plot can get rather involved, but you will follow it endlessly to see where you go. I was simply involved, hook, line and sinker.

See this movie more than once, and skip some of the other movies out now that are dare I say, trash.

This should be on the top of many critic's lists this year and it is certainly on top of mine.

My Rating (1 - 10): 10"
24. American Beauty,9/10,"if a movie changes your life or the way you see it, it is said that it did a great job.",
24. American Beauty,10/10,Movies like this are hard to come by these days,"This movie is so great because it's so relatable. I would rather watch this for the 10th time than watch most of the crap that Netflix is putting out there. Give me the Bravehearts and the Gladiators. I know I'm going to catch hell for not really reviewing American Beauty. This is more of a general praise for the great classics such as this one. Contrasting relationships. Couples that totally get each other and others that are completely clueless what the other really wants or needs. Cautionary tale about communication, or lack thereof. The character development in this film is amazing. And that's really what you want in a movie. You want to care about the least some of the characters.

24. American Beauty,10/10,a very well done film that continues to amaze me...,"When I first saw this movie in theaters, I found it to be very funny. When I rented it at home, I found it to be very sad and complex. Looking at it now, I realize that it is surely one of the most extraordinary films ever to come out of Hollywood. To some it may look trite or cliched, or maybe too un-ordinary to be worthy of its praise, but the overall impact of this film is extremely powerful. After you've seen it, you know you've seen something.

A few notable elements stand out. The direction is superb; this is visually a superior film, for the director understands the subtle changes in tone. The writing is equally compelling; the story effortlessly interweaves multiple stories to create one amazing movie. The haunting music is also notable. Lastly is the acting. Kevin Spacey has done excellent films before, and he can add this one to the list. He may be a little to witty to suggest the overshadowed character he portrays, but he simply disappears into the role. Annette Bening is also fine; a less strong role, but she is magnificent none the less. As the teenagers, Thora Birch is able to mesmerize us with one intense look; her ""typical teenager"" role is fleshed out completely. I enjoyed Mena Suvari's character equally. It seemed that she did not receive as much acclaim, but her performance evokes both innocence and experience, and her scenes toward the end give her a depth unlike any other character. And Wes Bentley, as the video-taping boy next door, is easily the most original character. At first he seems a little tense, but, like Spacey, he sinks into the role. His ""purpose"" in the film, unlike anyone else's, is a mystery, thus making him the most enigmatic person.

Most films are able to make a lasting impression on its audience, but never has a movie been known to ""move"" its viewers as much as this movie. It truly says something about life, no matter how predictable or tacky it appears, this film disturbingly shows us how to appreciate our individual lives, so therefore, when they are over, we each have something to remember."
24. American Beauty,7/10,"Delivers a beautiful, lasting message",
24. American Beauty,10/10,One of the 10 best films I have ever seen.,"This is a masterpiece, perfect in every way. It has completely changed the way I view films and the way I look at life. The acting is excellent, especially with Spacey and Bening. The directing by Mendes is one of the best I have ever seen in a film. The cinematography is so beautiful with the strong contrast between the red and other colors. Aside from being visually beautiful, the story itself is this film's best feature. It is original, with hints of humor, noir, drama, and sadness. Overall, it is thought-provoking in a way very few films are. It is hard to watch what these characters are doing because we know that they are only leading themselves to their own demise. Ball's screenplay is one that should be required reading in film schools and the final sequence is perhaps the most beautiful thing ever filmed. It is a stunning achievement, deserving of every award it got. It is, in my opinion, one of the 10 best films I have ever seen and the best film of the 1990s after Schindler's List. It is so real, so poignant, so heartbreaking. Powerful and serene, this is why I love movies. They can change your thinking.

24. American Beauty,10/10,My 600th review on IMDb and such a perfect movie for it!,"Makes me smile at so many scenes, well deserving of the 5 Oscars! The writing and emotions are exquisitely powerful yet somber. I absolutely love Kevin Spacey despite his personal life troubles and Annette Benning blows me out of the water every time. I'm delighted to own such a piece of art on Blu-Ray; American Beauty has been among my top favorites for a very long time I'd say number 8. The Soundtrack is one of the greatest things ever, to me this film is like a perfect tapestry after using the paint brush and Sam Mendes created it so well! Hope my thoughts aren't to over the top I just very much enjoy this movie!

24. American Beauty,10/10,Far and away the best film of the year,"What can I say, except that this film really knocked me on my keaster. I went in to the theater not knowing what to expect, but was pretty sure it would be worth the ticket price. Boy was I happy when I left. Not only was it worth the ticket, I paid to see this film two more times. This film is virtually perfect. The acting is superb, the story is magnificent, the narrative is brilliant, and the structure of the film is truly groundbreaking (absolutely loved the last 20 minutes). What really surprised me about this film was how well the cinematography was done. In a small, character driven film such as this, it is very unusual to have such great cinematography. With this film, there is something interesting going on in every scene, not many films you can say that about. In a year where first time directors have made some of the best films, Three Kings, Being John Malkovich, etc... Sam Mendes seems to have out-done them all. Though I have yet to see The Green Mile or Magnolia, I find it hard to believe that either film will out-shine American Beauty. This film should easily win a substantial amount of the Oscars this year. What's up with all the cirtics awards snubbing it so far?"
24. American Beauty,10/10,Powerful,"""My name is Lester Burnham. This is my neighborhood; this is my street; this is my life. I am 42 years old; in less than a year I will be dead. Of course, I don't know that yet, and in a way, I am dead already.""

""American Beauty"" is placed in an indefinite suburb somewhere in America (there are indications that it is Chicago), where a seemingly harmonious and quite ordinary family is going through the turbulence caused by the middle age crisis of both parents, as well as the puberty of their teenage daughter.

A patriarchal family, ruled by a conservative father, a military man, moves next door to them. While the daughter of our antihero Lester starts a relationship with the neighbor's weird son, and his wife has an affair at work, he, not so secretly, obsessively falls for his daughter's girlfriend.

This black humor drama is only seemingly extreme and eccentric, while in fact, it shows quite realistically what many of us go through at various moments in our lives. Admittedly, most only in their heads, and those who dare to take drastic steps usually hide it better. But the fact that most of us would never admit such thoughts and actions does not prevent, but perhaps only makes it easier for us to better connect with the characters and feel their drama more deeply.

A strong, well-written story needs actors capable of bringing it to life before our eyes. ""American Beauty"" did not fail in that field either. The excellent character study on paper makes the job much easier, but you can always rely on Kevin Spacey for a really impressive role. A man who somehow manages to be at the same time a nerd and a macho, slimy and sexy, a villain and a victim. Sexual and emotional frustration and the middle age crisis are by no means an excuse for Lester's actions, and yet, Spacey awakens sympathy and compassion in the viewer, rather than repulsion and disgust.

Annette Bening skillfully keeps pace with Spacey in the role of a frustrated woman, trapped in a long-extinguished marriage. A woman who, with the last twitches of common sense, tries to balance between a family in disarray and a career that she can never raise to a level that would satisfy her.

There is also Thora Birch, an unpopular teen, escaping from the collapse of her family home in a relationship with the eccentric Wes Bentley, as well as the insecure Mena Suvari, who is hiding under the mask of a confident and popular cheerleader. Her transformation from ""Lolita"" that seduces Lester to one of the most impressive scenes in the film, where she is half-naked, trembling under Spacey, does not deserve to remain unmentioned. Although her character is secondary to the others I mentioned and only serves as a support for Spacey's, Mena's performance is unfairly underrated. And last but not least, Chris Cooper who convincingly played a homophobic colonel and stole every scene in which he appears.

For me, the two most striking things in this film are the use of red and the unusual disturbing sounds that accompany Lester's fantasies, in contrast to the mainstream rock music that fills the rest of the movie. And of course, the ending is a bit over-the-top, but it perfectly rounds off the story and adds to its strength.

The film won five Oscars for best picture, directing, screenplay, cinematography, and Spacey's performance, and was also nominated for editing, music, and leading female role. Each well deserved.

24. American Beauty,10/10,My Favorite Film From the 90s,
24. American Beauty,10/10,"Mayn't be the most original movie I have seen, but it is still an outstanding movie","I wasn't expecting to like American Beauty, but I did, loved it more like. The story mayn't be original at first glance, but how the film is written and constructed more than compensates you completely overlook. You may argue the characters are weird and unlikeable, maybe so, but they are quite complex. Lester is a self-described loser who is unwanted by everyone, Carolyn is uptight and sexually frustrated, Jane is the epitome of a sulky teenage daughter and Allison is like a incipient Lolita who Lester becomes smitten with. American Beauty is probably an example of a movie that you may need to see more than once to truly appreciate it, I was like that with Vertigo.

What I love about American Beauty is not only the complex characters, but also the stylish filming, haunting score, side-splitting scenarios, the intelligent and darkly funny screenplay and the assured direction from Sam Mendes. Not to mention the performances which are nothing less than impeccable, especially Kevin Spacey who thoroughly deserved his Best Actor Oscar. Annette Bening, Peter Gallagher, Thora Birch and Mena Suvari give wonderful support too. Quintessentially, American Beauty is just a wonderful, funny and brilliantly performed and directed film. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
24. American Beauty,10/10,Look Closer...,"The first time I heard about this movie I thought it was this movie and about a man with cancer and then read a lot of good things about and then say some trailers and then I saw it. At first I did not like this movie but than say it again on T.V and then loved it ever since. This is one of the most original films I have ever seen. The performances are one of the best and more Oscars should have been handed out. The directing by Sam Mendes is superb and I'm glad that he won the Oscar. Alan Ball wrote one of the best screenplay and story's ever thought and there's a reason why he won the Oscar and most deserving. This is the Best of the 1990's and that decade had a lot of great movies came out( Goodfellas, L.A Confedintil, Pulp Fiction to name a few). This was the first movie that I saw that was perfect and I had to see it over and over so I can just uncover everything that was in this movie. This movie is in my top ten movies of all time and I'm glad that it's rank number 35 and that one of the reason why I joined this because it was the only website people respect my opinions and agreed with me. Keven Spacey gives his best performance and one of the best of time. Spacey brings a great performance for a really deep and is just a great character. Annette Bening does a great and for some reason missed the Oscar. Chris Copper does a great job and didn't get notice that much, also did Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari and thora Birch did a great job and should have more notice. Sam Mendes does a great directing job and is one the best film debut ever. This film was one the best ever made and should be seen by everyone hows looking for great movie or how just want have fun watching a movie."
24. American Beauty,10/10,Perfectly captures the dystopia of the USA at the turn of the millenia,"Greed and hate has destroyed the fabric of society in the USA and this film depicts a broken family that could be millions of families in suburban USA. I often think acting doesn't take much skill but movies like American Beauty help me appreciate truly fine acting. The film shows how one man finds redemption by breaking out of the cage his life had become. Despite a tragedy, the film ends on a positive note with the narration of the central character. One of my top 5 favorite movies. Congratulations to everyone who took part in the making of this movie.

24. American Beauty,6/10,American Ugly,"Much-praised film about a man facing mid-life crisis in suburbia, dreaming of playing Humbert Humbert to a Lolita that is his daughter's friend. There is only one word to describe this film: pretentious. Mendes thinks he is making the Great American Motion Picture but it is populated with cookie-cutter characters and it superficially touches on what the filmmakers regard as important themes. The acting is mediocre at best. Spacey gives the kind of performance that the Academy loves and awarded him with the Oscar but his acting here can be best described as mugging. Benning does not fare much better as his desperate wife.

25. Léon: The Professional,10/10,One of the greatest thrillers of all time.,"A hitman is forced to look after twelve year old Matilda, who's family has been killed.

Leon was and will forever be a masterpiece, it is a thought provoking, dramatic and pretty violent thriller, one that will actually challenge you, making you question what's actually happening in front of your eyes.

Violent and bleak in parts, but not lacking some humour, the game of charades for example is a real hoot, and breaks the serious narrative up a little.

Best scene for me, the showdown in The Gent's toilet, where Matilda finally confronts Stan, the acting is off the scale.

The relationship between Leon and Matilda is complex, but one thing that I noticed, is that every aspect of it is driven by Matilda, not Leon, he just goes with the flow.

The acting is phenomenal, there are a trio of first class performances, Jean Reno and Gary Oldman as you'd expect are captivating, but credit to a young Natalie Portman who is on par, defying her young age and inexperience, no wonder.

This amazing film still packs a punch.

10/10."
25. Léon: The Professional,10/10,Besson's masterpiece - action cinema with real heart,
25. Léon: The Professional,10/10,Masterful,"I have long thought that owning films on DVD or video is a waste of money - you watch them once and after that they are left to fester at the back of a cupboard. Occasionally I make an exception - some films simply cannot be fully appreciated on just one viewing. Every time I watch Leon is as gripping and enjoyable as the first. Sad, funny, violent, incredibly touching - few films manage to tick all the boxes and even fewer are about hitmen.

It obviously helps when your leading man has as much screen presence as Jean Reno. Thin and wiry with toilet brush hair and a face like a bag of spanners, he is hardly your typical gun-toting action hero, but he has an innocence and compassion that makes you fall for him instantly. Leon's life is as simple as a small child's: TV, lashings of milk and the odd gangland assassination. He cannot read, he doesn't sleep, he hasn't the trappings of family or wealth (the fees for his hits are habitually trousered by his `benefactor': sleazy small-time Italian gangster Tony (Danny Aiello)) - In short, he lives like a robot. And then he meets Mathilda.

Normally I can't stand Hollywood kids. They are all doey-eyed, bouffant-haired brats who can cry on cue and are always ready with a cutesy, smart-alec comment that will cause their adult co-stars to tinkle with laughter or tousle their hair playfully. Often they are kidnapped and huge ransoms demanded while their parents go demented with worry. I for one am usually rooting for the kidnappers.

Natalie Portman's Mathilda is the antithesis of these namby-pamby Dawson's Creek actors-in-waiting. For starters, she has something justifiable to gripe about, in that her entire family has just been slaughtered by Gary Oldman and his gang of crooked DEA officers. This is a bit of a blow, to say the least, but Mathilda takes it all in her stride and teams up with Leon in a bid for revenge. So begins one of the stranger relationships in silver screen history, but one of the most memorable.

On the face of it, a love story between a twelve year old girl and a hairy French hitman would raise a few eyebrows among more conservative movie-goers, but director Luc Besson handles it so beautifully, it seems like the most natural thing on earth. They are united in being totally alone in the world - indeed, the scene where Mathilda walks quietly down the corridor past the carnage in her apartment and knocks on Leon's door, imploring him in a tearful whisper to let her in is as breathtaking as it is heartbreaking. Leon is wary at first, but she soon wins him round and starts to gently bring him out of the shell.

Portman is truly astonishing - one can almost forgive her for being a part of the appalling Star Wars prequels on the strength of this one performance. The iconic image of this tiny, grubby little girl clutching Leon's beloved plant and trotting to keep up with her lanky hero's giant strides is one that will live long in the memory.

Aiello and Oldman (at his sadistic, malevolent best) provide predictably excellent support, there is a wonderfully suspenseful yet satisfying ending - heck, there's even a decent Sting song playing over the credits - for this (if nothing else) it would be remiss of me to give Leon anything other than top marks.

10/10"
25. Léon: The Professional,9/10,Walk the Line...,"Leon is a cleaner for his boss, it's like removing bits of debris when you floss, a variety of tools, he always plays by his set rules, now he's taken in a girl he's come across. She purports to be 18 but she's a child, had to grow up quick with a family that's quite wild, now they have wounds, that won't be healed, after messing with Stansfield, that's left her quite annoyed and somewhat, slightly riled. It's a story of revenge and adolescence, of walking a fine line that may cause offence, but there's chemistry and connection, performances played to perfection, quite original, without too much pretence.

Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and especially Gary Oldman are immense.

25. Léon: The Professional,9/10,Being a good hitman takes more than merely a willingness to lay down one's life.,"I first saw this in the late 90s. Then again in the mid 2k on a dvd i own.

Revisited the remastered extended version last night with my family.

This movie is more than just a hitman or an assassin movie.

The music is top notch, the characters are very well developed, the action scenes n direction are stylish.

But the best part are the scenes between Reno n Portman. Leon is amazingly n very differently portrayed by Reno.

There is a Bollywood copy known as Bichoo (Scorpio).

The only thing good in the Bollywood movie is that the guy who played Tony gives away all of the hitman's money to the girl whereas in the original, the character of Tony gives only a single currency note to Mathilda n keeps blabbing the same ""safer than the usual bank story""."
25. Léon: The Professional,10/10,A Perfect Chemistry,
25. Léon: The Professional,10/10,A shameful praise of a fantastic film.,
25. Léon: The Professional,10/10,Gripping story with well-crafted characters,"Luc Besson's movie Léon (The Professional) gives us an intense story which is maximized in potential by the casting of the movie done by Todd Thaler. Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package. Jean Reno plays a character named Léon who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a ""cleaner"", or hit-man. His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal.

The performance delivered by then twelve-year old Natalie Portman as Mathilda is nothing short of brilliant. Her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few, she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role. Mathilda and Léon are unexpectedly thrown together, but learn to value life from their chance encounter, and how valuable a friendship can be.

Jean Reno as Léon gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about. Mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had, while Léon serves as a father and friend to her. Gary Oldman, as the corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stansfield, offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope. He moves the story along by his actions. Oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants.

The Professional is what movie-making is all about. Without the overuse of special effects, a large shooting location, or a commercially star studded cast, we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie. Portman, Oldman, and Reno, along with Danny Aiello as the hit-contractor Tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting. There are elements of comedy, drama, and action, and great original music by Eric Serra adds to the energy the film already encapsulates. The most impressive thing about the movie is its story which is basic but is maximized by all the other elements which go into the making of the movie. Simply put, an intense and impressive movie."
25. Léon: The Professional,10/10,"A Tale of Revenge, Love & Life...","One of the most iconic Action films of all time, this story is about a ruthless hitman Jean Reno and his next door neighbour, 12 year old Natalie Portman who lives in an abusive household and how a tragedy makes this two tormented souls find each other, love and life again. Luc Besson directs this one with plenty of bloody and uber stylish action scenes and some really touching moments. The music is pretty damn fantastic and the editing is crisp. Jean Reno owns his role with stonecold attitude but also possess this awkward innocence. Portman gives probably the greatest performance from a Child Actor, playing a kid hungry for love but has grown up too quickly amidst crime. Gary Oldman goes off the hinges, playing a Crooked DEA cop, belting out one iconic line after another. You can watch this film again and again, a Masterpiece !!!

25. Léon: The Professional,9/10,Visceral and intelligent - Besson's masterpiece,"Leon is one of the most emotionally intense movies ever made. French director Luc Besson uses everything: actors, music, camera angles, lighting to create an unique experience - ""It's not realism, it's not naturalism - it's heightened reality"" as Gary Oldman very well put it.

In ""The making of The Professional"" Besson says ""If I imagine somebody in the street try to knock on my daughter, I kill the guy, in five seconds. I kill him, and I think ""It's in me, I'm a beast!"" On this part we can't forget that a part of us, the genetic things inside are much, much older than The Ten Commandments"". He certainly uses visceral scenes to create very strong emotion in the movie - the blood running from Mathilda's nose or Stansfield's unforgettable ""EVERYONE!"" are just a couple of examples. The music and the sound are excellent and are used in a masterly fashion - you can hear Fatman's heart beating desperately or a low claustrophobic sound when Stansfield turns to look at Mathilda's father.

However Leon does not work only on this primary level, it also has an intelligent story. It may seem to be almost a fairy-tale, but don't be fooled - just like his character Besson is serious. This movie has a message: without love we are dead, even if we don't see it. Only true love give meaning to our lives: ""everything else reminds me a big yogurt: warm and rancid"" as Mathilda says in the original script, which is available on the net under the name Leon Version 1. Is this true in ""real life""? I don't know but this movie can make you wonder.

Then of course there's the sensuality. It's hypocritical to deny it, the camera interacts with Mathilda in a mesmerising fashion. It's not sick and it's not degrading: it's art, subtle and beautiful.

Leon is not perfect but it has so many great moments that all its flaws can be forgiven. It's a movie that really should not be missed, unless you are concerned with its amorality. And don't be - Leon is less violent than many action movies and the unusual relationship between the main characters is handled mostly with genuine feeling and tact."
25. Léon: The Professional,7/10,a symphony in film,"luc besson will never top this movie. This is his benchmark, his classical composition. Look at the precise, intricate scenes. It's a symphony in cinema. Straight off, it's action. Intelligently shot, and scripted. It makes everything that follows hard to live upto. But it does so easily. It's stylish without being showy, it's deep without being sentimental. And it's just hugely enjoyable. Seeing the friendship between newly orphaned mathilda and skilled assasin leon bloom, is tenderly done. At risk of slipping into a sappy bond, besson keeps it easy on the emotions, without coming off as shallow.

The actors are all spot on, most notably the debut from a young natalie portman as mathilda. Showing an angry, sad, pent up, in love girl is no simple task but she breezes through it, touching all the right notes. And jean reno as the title character, is minimal but very effecting. Hard to understand, but easy to relate too. But gary oldman steals it, with his glorious overacting. He's as scary as he is determind. His line delivery is almost perfect. And his fate is very fitting. If only they made more intelligent action movies, then they could contend with this film. But as it stands right now, leon is one of the best action dramas ever made."
25. Léon: The Professional,6/10,Everything is overshadowed by unusually sexual undertones between Leon and Matilda,
25. Léon: The Professional,10/10,"Intense, gripping, stylish and poignant with one of the best feature debuts ever","Luc Besson's film Leon:The Professional is a superb one. Visually, it is very stylish, with striking location work, atmospheric lighting and really authentic and bold cinematography. The soundtrack also does very well in enhancing the mood of each scene, and Besson's direction is faultless.

There is also a gripping story with well crafted characters particularly Mathilda and Jean Reno's character Leon, a cracking script and crisp pacing and while there are some over-the-top and intense moments particularly with Stansfield and the beginning, particularly as the chemistry between Mathilda and Leon expands there are some poignant ones too.

The acting is excellent. Jean Reno is charismatic and commanding in the title role while Gary Oldman is wildly bombastic as Stansfield. But I was especially impressed by Natalie Portman, who delivers one of the best and most captivating feature debuts ever. In conclusion, a fantastic film. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
25. Léon: The Professional,10/10,A Brilliant Conflict,"This film, better known in the U.S. as ""The Professional"", is a wonderful and intense film. Jean Reno plays his role as a ""cleaner"" with incredible subtlety. Leon tries to keep his emotions completely suppressed, yet Matilda (in an extraordinary performance by a young Natalie Portman, who is destined to become a very powerful actress into her adult life) bring out in him a new-found joy for life that accompanies his growing paternal instincts. But, the most dynamic element of this film is undeniably Gary Oldman's performance as a wildly sadistic and crooked DEA agent with his own narcotic-induced demons. His obsessions eventually lead him to the brink of absolute madness in his hunt for the cleaner. Truly, this is Oldman's finest performance to date, worthy of Oscar glory, though sadly forgotten. And so, Luc Besson did indeed top his triumph of ""La Femme Nikita"" by far with this masterpiece. Though, I cannot exactly praise his most recent effort with the sci-fi misfire, ""The Fifth Element.""

25. Léon: The Professional,10/10,Very well executed,
25. Léon: The Professional,6/10,"Very good in some ways, problematic in others","When her family are slaughtered by a corrupt DEA officer and his men, a 12 year old girl takes refuge in a neighbour's apartment. A neighbour who it turns out is a professional hitman. She soon convinces him to train her to be his protégée.

This was French director Luc Besson's first American movie. It is a follow up of sorts to his earlier chic action-thriller Nikita (1990), with Jean Reno essentially reprising his role of a cleaner (professional assassin), although in this one he is playing a different character. Like all Besson's movies there is considerable style brought to the table with the action sequences once again particularly well-delivered. But perhaps the true revelation of the movie is Natalie Portman who puts in an extremely strong performance for such a young actress, full of charisma, humour and emotional depth. She plays off well against Reno, who is also impressive. Gary Oldman, on the other hand, is pretty grating and annoying mostly as the main villain, a character who is cartoonish and somewhat ridiculous overall.

While I do find this film good quality for the most part, with great action sequences and some interesting characterisations, I have to express serious reservations about the director's cut, where Portman's young character is constantly trying to get Reno to sleep with her. Its majorly uncomfortable stuff and really entirely unnecessary. And while Léon does spurn her advances, it's never really very clear that he rejects her for entirely the right reasons. Seemingly in the original script, the characters do actually end up sleeping together, which we can only be grateful never actually made the final cut but it does make you wonder what Besson was thinking with all this questionable stuff. My advice would be to avoid the director's cut and watch this one in the trimmed version, which removes all this contentious material."
25. Léon: The Professional,10/10,Masterpiece of violent Characterisations and fast action-shooting,"An interview with Anne Parillaud, in the Evening Standard, 24.8.90, it was said that the message of Nikita is not one of violence but the idea is that people who are full of despair and missing love are not alone.

This idea continues in Léon. Léon was Besson's first foray into international film production. The similarities, or parallels, between Nikita and Léon are undoubted. Both the central protagonists attempt to come to terms with their dysfunctionality, to society, against a background of violence, which they both continue to act upon as the agent of someone else. There is no clean difference (we may also include Le Dernier Combat for comparison.) The only difference is gender.

I always found that until obtaining the ""Version Integral"" there was a character hole in the plot. The original cut released for US audiences was felt, by Besson, had an ""offending"" scene cut which ruined later scenes. The American test audiences hated it, seeing it as perverse and paedophiliac. The film was still panned by US critics as quasi-child pornography on general release. What it to be understood about this film, and this is what infuriated Besson, is that the film is about pure love. Not sex, which is all the Americans, could see.

And so we have ascertained that the characters in Besson's films are, simply, great. Then there is the action which is all the grace and style of Nikita. Typical of Besson's style with fast action-shooting and violent characterisation. This has to be one of Jean Reno's and by far Natalie Portman's best screen performance. To me, Gary Oldman plays his part to the tee, said by some magazines to be the best screen bad guy - it is one of his best performances.

Stylisation and excess are hallmarks of Besson's work. Characters are larger than life. Décors are in excess of realism. Besson's characters lack psychological depth. ""The sumptuous and the ornate cohabit with the violent or the vulgar."" Besson's use of excess is also extremely playful mixing violence with humour. Besson's work appeals to the tastes of popular culture and may not please that of the elite - arguably a reason for the rejection of his work by many intellectual film journals.

I have yet to hear of a person putting a bad word against this film. There is nothing I can personally fault so I give this film 10/10, a score only two other somewhat different films hold in my IMDb list of 345 films - ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""La Cité des Enfants perdu"". If you like French Cinema or consider yourself a cinephile you must see the latter."
25. Léon: The Professional,9/10,"A thrilling crime film, in deep touch and care with the characters- Besson and Portman's best work to date","I sensed that Luc Besson (director of The Fifth Element and La Femme Nikita) was, like Tarantino and many, many others before him, borrowed elements from various films and genres to create their own voice in the film. With Leon, I sensed him alluding to the crime films of France (i.e. Melville), Hong-Kong (i.e. Woo), and America (i.e. Scorsese), and making it into his own special brand for the story and characters. That his style visually is as compelling helps a great deal. The international version (which is the one I saw) is a little grittier, and more suggestive, than the version most American audiences saw in 1994 and on cable. But it is also a must-see if you are planning to see the film. It's not a long movie, though it gives a good many details in its story.

Jean Reno has his star-making turn (at least for what he's worth) in Leon- he's ruthless contract killer who will kill just about anyone for the right price. He lives out of an apartment by himself, trying his best to ignore his noisy neighbors. One of the daughters is Mathilda (Natalie Portman, also a major breakthrough performance), abused by her whole family to no end. When a corrupt cop (Gary Oldman, one of the key villain performances of his career along with Dracula and Drexl in True Romance) goes and kills off her family while she's away, she has no one else to turn to besides the reclusive killer. She knows what he does, and she wants in. The rest of the film is about their relationship, as it unfolds professionally and emotionally, leading to a tremendous, bloody climax.

One thing that struck me most about Leon is the fact that the film was more disturbing than I expected. The idea of a killer getting a pupil in a young teenage girl is unusual enough, but the way it unfolds I felt so much for her plight got to me at times. this doesn't make Leon a tear-jerker (maybe for some, I'm not sure), but because of Portman's dead-on portrayal, it makes the story work somehow, and is in a way as fantastical as it is naturalistic. There are also a few scenes that stuck out as being little masterpieces of all the elements coming together. The first is a brief scene, and crucial to showing the character of Leon early on- he takes a break after his contract, and sees a movie, a musical with Gene Kelly. He's the only one in the theater, and he is completely in the grasp of what he sees on the screen. It's the perfect touch of humanity and shows his only escape is into complete fantasy.

The second is when Leon and Mathilda are in a restaurant, after she has just gone through a day of training (there's a hilarious montage that follows this scene). Mathilda is getting drunk off of champagne, rambling with words she may or may not mean. Suddenly, she starts laughing, and she laughs more, and harder. People in the restaurant look at her like she's nuts. Leon is, of course, embarrassed. However, I thought this was just the right touch to this scene, where the kind of father-daughter relationship going on between Leon and Mathilda is revealed. It's not exactly funny, not even really cringe worthy. It just is. The third scene is when Mathilda decides to pay a visit to the man who murdered her family. She follows the man into the bathroom, and waits. Suddenly, he (Oldman) appears out from behind a door. The language used, the tenseness of the two off of one another, it's simply the most terrifying scene in the picture (aside from the first violent turning point).

So, basically, when Leon finished, I think I realized that my reaction was this: if I had seen this film when I was younger, be it in high school or even middle school, I would've responded to it even more strongly than I do now. There's something very visceral about the nature of violence and killing, as well as the mentor/pupil relationship, that Besson really gets down pat. While some of the situations have the chance of slipping into clichés, it doesn't happen very often. Leon: The Professional, is hard-hitting when it has to be, soft and funny when it can, and does stay with the viewer a few days after it's over."
25. Léon: The Professional,10/10,"Excellent, smart action film.","Luc Besson's ""The Professional"" is sort of a companion piece to his international breakthrough hit ""La Femme Nikiti"", and in many ways it's an even better film. It raises the stakes of Besson's playful women-with-guns theme by making the heroine a 12-year-old, played by a then unknown Natalie Portman. Jean Reno is excellent as her assassin trainer and surrogate father. Oldman is completely over the top in one of his best bad-guy roles, obsessed with both Beethoven and butchery. As a gritty, suspenseful thriller, this film won't leave action fans feeling cheated, but the film is so much more than that. At the center of ""The Professional"" is a wonderful father and daughter-like relationship between two damaged strangers who find solace in each other.

25. Léon: The Professional,10/10,An Action Film For Lovers,
25. Léon: The Professional,9/10,One of the Greats of the 1990s,"Mathilda Lando (Natalie Portman), a 12-year-old girl, who is reluctantly taken in by Léon Montana (Jean Reno), a professional assassin, after her family is murdered. Léon and Mathilda form an unusual relationship, as she becomes his protégée and learns the assassin's trade.

This is what you get if you take ""Lolita"" (sort of) and put it in the middle of a world with mobsters and hit men. And then casting for perfect actors? Priceless. Luc Besson probably had no idea that Portman would go on to be the international sensation she has become.

Of course, we also have a solid performance from the always-impeccable Gary Oldman. Very few actors are working on his level. Maybe Daniel Day-Lewis, possibly Christian Bale. But Gary Oldman can be anyone and delivers 100% every time.

Roger Ebert gave the film only two-and-a-half stars out of four, writing, ""Always at the back of my mind was the troubled thought that there was something wrong about placing a 12-year-old character in the middle of this action... In what is essentially an exercise—a slick urban thriller—it seems to exploit the youth of the girl without really dealing with it."" Not to disregard his concern, but time seems to be against Ebert here. The film has steadily gone up in praise over the years, possibly due to Portman's rising star."
25. Léon: The Professional,7/10,The hit-man and her.,"An unlikely relationship forms between 12-year-old Mathilda (Natalie Portman), who seeks revenge on the gangsters who slaughtered her family, and an assassin, Léon (Jean Reno), who lives in the same apartment building and teaches her how to 'clean'.

A love story between a grown man and a twelve year old girl: sounds a bit dodgy, doesn't it? Director Luc Besson tries his hardest to pull it off by making Reno's character almost childlike, and having Portman's Mathilda act well beyond her years, swearing, smoking, and more than capable of looking after herself. In the end, though, it still feels very awkward

Sporting a Louise Brooks bobbed haircut and wearing shorts and a vest, Mathilda is definitely sexualised, kinda like a cross between Lolita, Mindy from Kick Ass and that girl from Lazy Town, which makes her relationship with Léon rather uncomfortable viewing at times, especially when the characters declare their feelings for each other, or when Mathilda tells a hotel manager that she is Léon's lover.

Thankfully, the film's love angle is never developed beyond the platonic, and Besson breaks up the emotional drama with numerous shootouts and explosions as Mathilda tries to find and kill villain Stansfield (Gary Oldman) with help from Léon. It's mindlessly entertaining, I suppose, but not nearly good enough to warrant the film's current IMDb ranking (#27 in the Top 250).

6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb."
25. Léon: The Professional,8/10,Luc Besson style of violent action,"Léon (Jean Reno) is a milk-drinking illiterate hit-man for Italian mob boss Uncle Tony (Danny Aiello) in NYC with his favorite plant. His next door neighbor 12 year old Mathilda (Natalie Portman) has an abusive father (Michael Badalucco) who skimmed drugs off of Stansfield (Gary Oldman). Stansfield massacres the family. She comes home to find Stansfield's men still there. She fakes and walks over to Léon's. It turns out that they are corrupt DEA agents. Léon the cleaner reluctantly lets her in and she badgers him to teach her. She seeks revenge on his little brother's murderers.

Director Luc Besson brings his often collaborator Jean Reno to America and makes a nice discovery with a young Natalie Portman. Before Hit-Girl, there was Mathilda. Gary Oldman is a superb strange bad guy. Luc Besson has a certain French flair with his action. He really has a unique take on the action thriller genre. It definitely has an edgy violent style that sometimes sexualized the young Portman. She takes on a lot of adult tendencies. That probably held it back a little back in the day."
25. Léon: The Professional,10/10,Where are the accolades?,"This movie is rated 63 on the imdb top 250 movie list, showing that people obviously like this movie, and with good reason. But why the hell didn;t this movie garner at least one single oscar or golden globe nomination??

natalie portman's performance was terrific as the emotionally ravaged matildha - best actress nomination for sure.

jean reno should have been nominated for a best actor nomination. the fact that the audience is led to feel sympathy and sorrow for a hitman speaks words enough about his performance.

gary oldman is fantastic as the corrupt and psychotic cop. his character is so repulsive and chilling, but at the same time so quirky and interesting to watch. best supporting actor nomination.

luc besson. when this man will get some kudos for his work i never know. the professional, in my opinion, is his greatest achievement as a director and, considering the fact he has helmed classic cult films such as nikita and the fifth element, the professional must rate highly as one of the best films of the 90's atleast! best film and best director nominations should have been given.

but no, it was all too easy to heap praise on the feel good movie forrest gump, and shun the movie that, through its intensity and tragedy, better highlights the value of life and love."

26. Joker,10/10,Perfect in every aspect.,"Truly a masterpiece, The Best Hollywood film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And truly the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife. Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting. Some people are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, but it's a necessity and message. It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too. The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different. It's BELIEVABLE. There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people. Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film.

26. Joker,10/10,"A psychological study, rather than a superhero flick","I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.

Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.

It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least. It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.

Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).

I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing."
26. Joker,10/10,Went for a second time to watch,"I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it.

26. Joker,10/10,JUST AMAZING. How does this movie exist.,"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director

26. Joker,10/10,Outstanding movie with a haunting performance and best character development ever seen,"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.

this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen.

But truly, this movie should encourage each and every one of us to become a better person, treat everyone with respect and make each other feel like they belong in this world, instead of making them feel isolated.

26. Joker,7/10,Is it great? I don't know.,"When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.

Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.

Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.

Film of the year? Nope."
26. Joker,10/10,MASTERPIECE 😍,"Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime

26. Joker,6/10,"Worthy Acting Performance By Phoenix Worth a Watch, but This Joker is Not Smart Enough to Become the Joker We've Come to Know",
26. Joker,5/10,Acting Cannot Save Mediocre Script,"They say it's all in the writing. And this is a great example of that. Good acting and production values cannot save a script steeped in tiresome stereotypes and a failure to delve into a character's identity. We meet the Joker when already imbalanced and his so-called descent into madness is really a couple weeks away; far from a descent, it's a stroll. This is not a character study, despite claims to the contrary. It's a showcase of a good actor overly contorting his body and laughing manically as a mistaken expression of madness. Where is the past? Where are the influences? Where are the conflicts? What are the seminal moments that create the spiral? Perhaps if he had really had that relationship, and had it gone sour, it would justify a descent. Instead, it's a fait accompli. This is lazy writing, focused more on fancy long shots of Joaquin Phoenix dancing crazily than producing something of value to the franchise.

26. Joker,10/10,The Hype is real,"Most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of ""pernicious violence"" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven't seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever ""deserved"" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway.

It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.

26. Joker,10/10,It's About a Man,"While I've watched many of the superhero movies that have come down the pike, they are often the same. So the compensation for sensational plots involves great special effects and non-stop action. They are fun and I don't mean to dis them. What is missing is a truly psychological drama. We don't get into the heads of the characters. This film is incredible as we watch a man confront his demons. We see him made fun of, attacked, and beaten. When he responds, he is seen as crazy. He also find that he is diminished in the eye of a counselor, and his mother has kept a secret. I thought it gave us a foundation for the Batman mythos without getting to deeply into it. Acting, atmosphere, and a sophisticated plot makes this a really excellent film.

26. Joker,8/10,"""That's Life.""",
26. Joker,7/10,OMG - Am I getting old or are people getting more stupid,"I was so hyped up to see this movie, loved the trailer, only movie I have wanted to watch in the cinema for a very long time.

I watched it and was bored. the aesthetics were amazing, music was good, story and execution was meh. the performance of the joker was a good performance but people raving about this are driving me mad. either you have not seen many movies or I have seen too many.

this movie was bang average and was actually boring. I was actually thinking about leaving half way through as I was bored out of my mind.

I do not regret watching it but it is being so overhyped that I am so confused right now. I think it had a good premise but could have been so much more, so much more.

Signs of a great movie is the repeat viewing of it or it moving you, joker did not move me whatsoever and I would not watch it again.

I thought maybe people are getting paid to write good review but have actually met people who think it is the best movie ever.... OMGGG

This movie is bang average and way overhyped.

phoenix performance is good but as the story and execution is so bad, I feel he never even touched the higher spectrum of performance he could have with the character.

I have experienced and seen worse in my life, if this made you feel, you are (i hate this word but have to use it) a snowflake. Please get off social media and live life.

there is a real world out there."

26. Joker,7/10,Between a 7 and an 8,"I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point.

26. Joker,5/10,Superficial and often tedious but what a performance!,"In the non-canonical origin story Joker, Joaquin Phoenix plays a deeply disturbed man named Arthur Fleck as he experiences through a series of traumas that turn him into the notorious supervillain.

Phoenix is terrific as the agonized loser with a compulsive-laughter condition. He's weird and creepy and full of angst and anger and self-loathing and everyone-else-loathing.

The first half hour is simply a grinding, agonizingly slow moving portrayal of Arthur's life. Then there's a moment of stunning, electrifying violence. And then everything gets tedious again.

Joker is not a supervillain movie, it's an artsy character study, and if you like those then this might appeal to you. But there's a superficiality to it all. Arthur is deeply disturbed and living in a city where society's have-nots are increasingly disenfranchised, but the script and director don't really seem to have anything to say about mental illness or inequality and injustice.

In the run-up to the film, director Todd Phillips criticized ""woke"" culture and the far left, and perhaps that's part of the problem. Woke culture says we need to think about things deeply, and Phillips really, really seem loathe to delve into what it means to be mentally unstable and poor in the greater societal sense. He's only concerned with how it effects Arthur. Arthur is also only concerned with how it effects Arthur, and the result is a film that seems to accept that Arthur is a victim of an unjust society while never really considering why the society is unjust or how much of Arthur's problems might be the result of his own narcissistic self pity.

But the main problem with the movie is it's slow-moving and dull far more often than not. I wouldn't recommend it."
27. Terminator 2: Judgment Day,10/10,Note to Hollywood: This is how you make an action film.,"And yes, I'd consider this more of an action film than Sci/fi since it takes place in contemporary times and locations. Nowadays, it can be hard to distinguish an action film from a video game. In fact there is one coming out soon that appears to be both. I guess studios these days feel that kids need something to see while resting their fingers after long days of playing their Nintendos/Playstations/whatever. So they come up with all of these PG-13 action films that are often mere meditations of comic books, toys, or old TV shows. Looking back at T2, one may find the action films of today sorely lacking in comparison.

The story of course deals with Arnold returning from the future to protect a boy who will some day lead the human resistance against a world run by machines. This time Arnold is the good guy (as per Schwarzenegger's request) and he's up against a lethal and much more advanced prototype sent to off the kid. The CGI used to create this new T-1000 terminator was jaw-dropping at the time this was released. Though technology to create such things is now infinitely more available, this has led to problems in my book. Now, there is too much done with computers, and stunts don't seem so wonderful if you know it was all done on a computer. Most of the stunts in T2 were live action and extraordinarily filmed using all types of vehicles and explosives. Director James Cameron really sold these stunts in terms of how he filmed them.

Not all directors are a good as Cameron. That is a given. But directors looking at making action films should take note of other strengths found in the construction of T2. First of all, you don't need shaky camera movements to sell to your audience that there is an exciting or crucial scene happening. Here the photography is crisp and detailed. You see everything clearly that you need to see. Right down to the little things. The action sequences are perfectly blocked and the spacing between hostile parties is easy for the audience to figure out. We know who is shooting at who, and how far apart they are from each other. Cameron also made sure his entire cast was proficient with the weapons they were going to fire in the movie. And guns run out of ammunition and need to be re-loaded at appropriate times. Nothing seems artificial in a shootout.

I could go on forever pointing out good qualities of this film. Just watching a bit of it on Bravo the other night reminded me why I saw it so many times in the theater. And this film was rated R! And it still made a fortune! That just proves if you make a good product, you don't have to dumb it down or tame it for the kiddies. If it's good enough, they'll find a way to see it! 10 of 10 stars. Unfortunately, the inspiration seems to have left this series with Cameron.

The Hound."
27. Terminator 2: Judgment Day,10/10,Movie that everyone should see!,"Greetings from Lithuania.

WOW! The best word that describes this movie is ""wow""! Not only to say that this is the best Action movie of all time, this is probably one of the greatest movies ever made . The people in my country watched this film when there where limited VHS cassettes at all. And again, my favorite Director did an timeless epic-masterpiece. Yes, an epic. Every scene in this movie is beyond the perfection. The timeless plot. Groundbreaking effects. Unforgettable ""Hasta la vista, baby."" .

Perfect direction for a sci-fix action film. When the action starts, you're in for the ride of your life. There never be the same movie like T2. What else I can say about this film? A Must see for everyone.

27. Terminator 2: Judgment Day,10/10,This is the sequel that dreams are made of.,"Normally when people tell you about a sequel that was better than the original or just as good, Terminator 2 is always guaranteed to be in their list; why? Because this is THE action movie of all action movies, next to Die Hard, this is the movie that isn't just about the action as well, but has an incredible story and message behind it that will always stay with you. Terminator 2 like the first Terminator film has memorable lines, moments, and incredible effects. This is the film that made you believe in ""liquid metal"" machines. Robert Patrick's performance is flawless, to be honest I found him a million times more terrifying than Arnold in the first Terminator, because Robert looks like this normal average guy, but he's not like Arnold where he gets shot and you can clearly see he's a terminator, Robert goes back to human looking and won't stop. Not only that you don't know how to stop him. Linda Hamilton returns and gives a great performance as Sarah Conor who is no longer a meek little girl, she has turned into a strong woman who will do anything to protect her son and the future. Arnold is back and he's better then ever! No wonder in the future they made several terminators that look like him, he's great entertainment.

Eleven years after Sarah Connor destroyed the original Terminator that was programmed to kill her, two Terminators arrive in Los Angeles from the year 2029. The first is a Terminator identical to the one that Sarah first encountered, while the second is a new model which assumes the identity of a police officer. John Connor is now a 10 year old living with foster parents. Sarah's experiences have made her tougher and more vigilant, but also desperate to warn humanity about the coming apocalypse. After attempting to bomb a computer factory, Sarah is arrested and remanded to the Pescadero State Hospital for the Criminally Insane under the supervision of Dr. Silberman. Meanwhile, the Terminators locate John Connor in a mall. After John is rescued and a chase through the L.A. storm drain channels, the original Terminator escapes with John on his motorcycle. The Terminator explains that he is reprogrammed by the future John Connor to protect and obey John's younger self. The other Terminator is a T-1000, an advanced new prototype programmed to kill John. It is made of ""a mimetic polyalloy"", a liquid metal that allows it to take the shape and appearance of anything it touches. It can also form into knifes and stabbing weapons. Learning that the T-1000 will likely kill Sarah and then mimic her to lure John, John orders the Terminator to help free her. Initially, Sarah is terrified by the Terminator; but after seeing it fight off the T-1000, she accepts that they need its help. As they escape the city, the Terminator informs John and Sarah about Skynet, the sentient computer system that will nearly wipe out humanity in an apocalyptic nuclear attack on ""Judgment Day"".

Terminator 2 is one of the best films of all time, this is a film that I absolutely adore and if someone hasn't seen it, there's something seriously wrong. This story is a special one: humans, are we our own worst enemy? Arnold's line ""It's in your nature to destroy yourselves"" is something that always sends chills down my spine because it's true. I loved the relationship between Arnold and Eddie Furlong, interesting to see a terminator take the place perfectly of a father and you see the pain in Eddie's eyes of never wanting to let go of the terminator. Like Sarah Conor said "" The terminator wouldn't stop, it would never leave him. It would never hurt him or shout at him or get drunk and hit him or say it was too busy to spend time with him. And it would die to protect him."" meant a lot to me. Like I said, if for some odd reason you have seen this movie, do see it! I promise you that it's just an excellent film and one that will always stand out against cinematic history.

27. Terminator 2: Judgment Day,10/10,"This Terminator Sequel, may prove to be the best sequel ever made.",
27. Terminator 2: Judgment Day,10/10,He Said He'd Be Back...and He Certainly is!,"Who said sequels aren't any good? ""Terminator 2"" is the ultimate sequel, a big bad wolf ready to chomp the head off of anyone who crosses its path. It's dark, it's mean, and it's one tough movie. It's not as bleak as the first film, at least in terms of visuals, but rather has a new kind of bluish-tint that supplies a great backdrop to the ongoing battle between man and machine.

If there was ever a contemporary mainstream visionary director, it is James Cameron. Here we've got Cameron's real thoughts on the series, those repressed by a low budget in the original film. He lets loose here, filling every frame with hard-boiled action and special effects. He introduces a liquid metal Terminator that he wanted to use in the first film, but graphic processors and CGI were not advanced enough in 1984, at least not advanced enough to work on the low means he had to film the original. So his original dream is finally unveiled, and good golly, is it wonderful.

Yeah, he's ""back."" Arnold (like he needs any introduction?) returns as The Terminator, Series T-101, Model T-800, an indestructible cyborg sent from the future to assassinate Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) in the first film. Well, it's 1991. New film. New mission. He has to save the future resistance leader of mankind who will ultimately defeat the machines of the future, John Connor (Edward Furlong), Sarah's 11-year-old son. (Though his age has been switched from 11 to 13 and back to 9 over the years, with no help from the third film that takes place in 2003, yet claims he was 13 in 1991 though his age doesn't match with his age in the third. We'll just leave it at 11 in this film. Got that?)

Another model Terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), has been sent back to 1991 programmed to annihilate John Connor. Which explains Arnold's appearance. Arnold, an undoubtedly lesser opponent compared to the T-1000, has to help save the day and learn to appreciate humanity. It won't be easy. First, he has to find John Connor, who is a rebellious angst-driven pre-teen living with foster parents. Then, together they have to break into the local loony hospital and release Sarah from the clutches of Dr. Silberman (Earl Boen), who believes Sarah is delusional. (You may remember Silberman as the psychiatrist from the first film, too.) Then, they have to stop a computer chip designer (Joe Morton) from creating the first version of a SkyNet computer, modeled after a destroyed chip his employment company discovered at a large mechanical warehouse. (Which is, of course, the chip from the destroyed T-800 of the first film.)

Whew. On with the film analysis, right? Where to start? This isn't as fierce or brutal as the first film, but it's got plentiful action sequences, a large budget, great special effects (even compared to those gracing the screen nowadays), not to mention a great character study of the machine we loved to root against in the first film. Of course, this Terminator has no memory of the first film, since he wasn't in it--SkyNet creates hordes of the same version machines on a large conveyor belt and ships them off to fight in the war. Some are sent back through time. So, with that in mind, John Connor's resistance found an extra Arnold lying around in an abandoned warehouse, programmed him to keep John Connor out of harm, and sent him through the time portal.

Sarah doesn't trust him. In a deleted scene available on the Ultimate and ""Xtreme"" edition DVDs, Sarah says, ""You don't know what it's like to try and kill one of these things!"" It's an important scene that should have been left in the final cut. In it, Sarah is about to destroy the machine's central processing chip located inside his head, when John stops her. It's important because it focuses on the fact that Sarah still doesn't trust him, and came close to destroying him purely out of prejudice, without giving him a chance. As much as I don't like it when people go on about hidden meanings in films that obviously are not meant to have hidden meanings and are purely little flubs made by directors unrightfully analyzed for deeper meaning(s), ""T2"" clearly has an underlying message: One, don't judge a book by its cover. Read it first. Two, if an emotionless killing machine can learn to appreciate life, why can't everyone? And three, the most important fact of all: Never mess with a muscular man who walks into a bar completely naked and requests your clothes and means of transportation.

I suppose the question on most interested viewers' minds is this: Is ""T2: Judgment Day"" better than its predecessor? Well, in some respects, yes. In others, no. It lacks the fierce brutality and darkness of the first film, but makes up for it with spectacular visual effects and action sequences. It lacks the horrific central focus of the first film (futuristic, indestructible cyborgs with no feelings being able to unemotionally kill), but it makes up for this with a new focus of humanity, coming to accept your future, and how it would look if two colossal killing machines entered into an arena together.

In some ways, I like the first better. But then I think about the second film and I have a hard time choosing. I suppose if I had to choose I'd choose the first film. And let me just state for the record that I'm glad I don't have to choose.

5/5 stars."
27. Terminator 2: Judgment Day,10/10,The best action sequel of all time and one of the best Schwarzenegger's movies my personal favorite,"Terminator 2: Judgment Day is (1991) is the best action sci-fi flick movie from the 90's ever made of all time. Terminator 2 is my personal favorite film I absolutely love this movie to death! Is my number 1 best movie ever till today the best of the best epic movie of all time. T2 was nominated for 4.Oscars the only movie of the franchise was nominated for an Oscar. If you watch T2 carefully and follow the story you never got bored and you are very entertained. This movie kicks ass! I love the hospital scenes mostly at night, the Cyberdyne building action sequences and of course steel mill action sequences are perfect for this film. This film deals with a lot of action, sci-fi and does involves a lot of paradox past travel. There is a lot of explosions and automatic weapons used in the movie and they are used well thousands of bullets are fired and explosive projectiles are fired at the police cars.

Arnold Schwarzenegger as the good terminator T-800 did an awesome Terrific real job, he acted believably as one of his best characters I ever saw on screen. Terminator walks to the front of the building and kicks a desk out a window. Than ignores the police's order to surrender and fires a M134 Minigun with Chainsaw grip at the police cars below, avoiding the humans. The helicopter pilot moves away. Terminator than uses a M79 grenade launcher to destroy two more vehicles. Its heads-up display indicates no human casualties. The film has a heart and is the best film in the world.

Robert Patrick as T-1000 is ""a mimetic Polly-alloy"" or ""liquid metal."" He can shape shift to match other people he touches, after first arriving in present time, he decides to have his base form be that of a nearby cop he killed and passes himself off as a cop in that form. The truck chase scene is awesome and the crash is also awesome. The truck that hit in to another column in the canal and explodes, T-1000 emerges as a shiny, featureless, liquid metal figure. Its features become more pronounced and its colors return to normal, returning to the form of the unharmed pseudo-cop is awesome. It shows what his character can do.

Linda Hamilton is the only Sarah Connor she acted her character perfectly here she played her character genius and very convincing and real, tough beyond all belief and completely focused on preventing the nuclear war and ensuring John's safety. Sarah Connor is her best performance ever in the both Terminator films. Little out of her mind with paranoia and anger: amazingly, you see actual character development (specifically, when John and T101 arrive at Dyson's house to prevent her from doing what she wants to).

Edward Furlong, is the only John Connor for me, is not bad himself as the extroverted kid who's confused by the fact that everyone except his mom told him his entire upbringing was based on a lie. The bit players all do their jobs well. Earl Boen plays the semi-sadistic mental hospital warden Dr. Silberman from the first film The Terminator (1984) that stands between Sarah Connor and her son (until the T1000 makes a chilling entrance).

Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong and Robert Patrick did there best acting performances, those actors who played there characters are beloved till this days and Terminator 2 has since been ranked as one of the greatest action, science fiction sequel films of all time.

Twin sister of Linda Hamilton also appeared as Leslie Hamilton Gearren as Twin Sarah in dream she was for real there wasn't no CGI in here. Twin brothers Don Stanton and Dan Stanton both of actors appeared in here one as Lewis the Guard the other as Lewis as T-1000 who kills lewis they were for real no CGI, except special effects for T-1000 knife. Terminator special effects were designed by Stan Winston R.I.P. who has done incredible job making those effects.

The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments. T2 is James Cameron masterpiece. This wouldn't be an action movie without some action. James Cameron writes, produces and directs brilliantly this film. Brad Fiedel does a perfect music score to the film. American rock band Guns N' Roses wrote a single for this movie ""You Could Be Mine"" and Schwarzenegger appeared in the music video as T-800 in the music video for this movie.

The chopper scene that crashed in to a SWAT van and explodes was awesome. The CGI and special effects are awesome. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task actors, stunts, puppetry, models and special effects designed from Stan Winston.

It is Rated R for strong sci-fi action and violence, and for language, it is a perfect film from the 90's that I have grew up with it. 10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval"
27. Terminator 2: Judgment Day,10/10,"A bigger, richer sequel that is every bit as fantastic as its predecessor and even surpasses it in some areas","The original Terminator film is one of the greatest films of the action genre, and still holds up as a fantastic film, not just of its genre but in general too. Terminator 2: Judgement Day is considered one of the best sequels ever made, and it is a consensus that I agree with. While it does lack somewhat in its predecessor's darkness and brutality, it delivers just as much in the writing and action and feels bigger and richer.

Here in Terminator 2: Judgement Day the budget is clearly bigger. This is especially true in the special effects, they were the only things in the first film that didn't hold up as well as the rest of the film but they were still not bad at all, here the effects are stunning, the liquid melting effects on the T-1000 model blow the mind still today. It is photographed slickly and beautifully, maintaining the dark audaciousness of the first film., and while the sets and lighting are not quite as nightmarish they are every bit as imaginative and atmospheric. It is superbly directed by James Cameron, and it's scored appropriately hauntingly.

Terminator 2: Judgement Day's script is just as snappy and even takes on a hard-edged tone in some parts, more so than the original, while the roller-coaster action is thrilling in every sense, without being overblown or dominating the film too much at the expense of depth, the bigger budget aiding and adding to the experience rather than swamping it. The story is still enormous fun, beautifully paced with few if any longueurs and very suspenseful.

Linda Hamilton gives another terrific performance, that is more depth than her performance in the first film, Robert Patrick is spine-chilling and once again Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast in by far his most conic role that was tailor-made for him.

In conclusion, a fantastic sequel that deserves its distinction as one of the best sequels ever made. It's the only Terminator sequel to be close to the quality of the original, and the only one that's above good level. For me, if asked which is the better film between the first film and this they're about equal, in their own ways 10/10 Bethany Cox"
27. Terminator 2: Judgment Day,10/10,The purest form of action cinema there is,
27. Terminator 2: Judgment Day,10/10,"Awesome action sequences, terrific sound effects n superb cgi. The chase sequence is awesome.","I still remember seeing this movie for the first time in 1993 on a VHS. I was completely blown away by the action, special effects n sound. Bought the VHS in '94 n saw countless number of times that the VHS nearly got burned out. Bought a DVD recently n revisited it. T2 is a timeless movie. It is much better than the original. It has superb car chases, big guns, dynamic explosions, gore, tension, suspense, etc. The chase sequence is awesome and nail bitingly intense, it is one of the best action sequences ever made. The pacing is impeccable and the action sequences still stands out. This movie has awesome sound effects, perfect cinematography n impeccable editing. I don't think there must b an action fan who hasn't seen this movie. It has an awesome cgi, action n sound effects. The scene in the Institute where Arnie walks in slow motion with a shot gun n Patrick, the cold emotionless killer, approaching is so full of tension. This movie also has a creepy n dreadful atmosphere. The movie is very violent n action packed.

27. Terminator 2: Judgment Day,10/10,surpasses the original,"Terminator 2 perhaps shows that Cameron was at least was cognizant of life and its meaning. I mean, this IS the movie where the end of the world has the most impact outside of Dr. Strangelove, right? One of those outstanding dream scenes in movies, one of the ones that actually works because it's true in its savage simplicity, Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor sees herself in her 1984 waitress get up with baby John in a playground and then everything gets wiped out by the BIG BOMB (Dmitri) that also incinerates Hamilton into BBQ.

So it's with this kind of thought that Terminator 2 means to be the most kick-assingest blockbuster of its (or all?) time while trying to keep the loss of life very small - or, rather, the ""Bad"" Terminator who was designed by the wizards at ILM can kill to its mission's content - I mean, DAMN, it still looks great, and in its silver-liquid-chrome simplicity much more, for me, impressive than the clanging junk of Bay disasters. It's arguable, of course, that the Terminator (T-800) does kill some people, incidentally, or, you know, all that gas from the gun he shoots could make some people really screwed up but, hey, ""He'll live"" is enough.

But if Cameron is ""soft"" at all here, it doesn't show too much... well, okay, Lil' John (hehe) does squeak and squak those early 90's amorphisms ""No Problemo - chill out - listen to Kriss Kross - etc"", and Edward Furlong is one of the things that just does not hold up here. He's serviceable at best, annoying at worst. He can cry okay though.

But it's Arnold, in his swaggering low-key and then with an occasional grin awesome leading man turn, and especially Linda Hamilton who make this tight script so compulsively watchable. Hamilton makes Connor into what Cameron likely saw in his one-time wife/collaborator Bigelow - a take-no-prisoners soldier who can take charge and has muscles and can probably knock you upside the head (maybe that's why they divorced, he couldn't take all that woman... but I digress, at any rate he moved around a lot till his current wife) And there is also a vulnerability still to Sarah that makes her so endearing.

She can never be completely hard, though time and experience and the dread of what's to come had scarred her, so by the time she has the chance to kill the Man Who Destroys The World, she can't do it. A scene like that is probably more emotionally gripping than so many other scenes that try in these blockbusters (something like Days of Future Past, which is a cousin of this flick, gets there). The fact Hamilton wasn't able to parlay such high caliber performance work into a better career is kind of sad, but at least this stands as a benchmark of a woman action hero, one of the two Cameron Wonder Women really.

So, blast your Guns N Roses, say hi to the kid from Salute Your Shorts (that's him, right, Connor's friend in the first act?) and ride your motorcycle through LA - it's a bad mother-jammer of a blockbuster that holds up enough to look over its faults (i.e. some dialog isn't tight, like the voice-over, it's alright but whatever - perhaps it was ambitious enough to best The Perfect Action Movie, which the first Terminator just was)."
27. Terminator 2: Judgment Day,10/10,Words cannot describe the greatness of this movie,"A Terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger) was sent from the future to kill the unborn son of Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton) in the original. Now, that Terminator has been sent back again but with a different assignment: Protect John Connor. John Connor(Edward Furlong) is now about 10 years of age and must evade a new Terminator sent to kill him;The T-1000(Robert Patrick). Sarah, John, and The Terminator journey together on their quest to stop Judgement Day, with a trailing, shape-shifting Termiantor trailing from behind.

This is the greatest of the Terminator trilogy. I have watched three times in the past year and have not found anything that Cameron could have improved on. The move is a masterpiece in every aspect of film. Schwarzenegger's acting might not be incredible but this is the perfect role for him. He isn't supposed to show emotion or feelings. He is a machine. I hate almost every one of his movies besides this trilogy because he is a horrible actor but he works perfectly into this role.

The special effects are incredible beyond belief. The shape-shifting T-1000 is some of the greatest animation I have witnessed in cinema history. It absolutely blew my mind when I first experienced this visual extravaganza. The animation looked so real(remembering this was a good ten years). The movie included fast-paced action along with some clever sci-fi drama/horror. The idea of a vast army of machines taking over the world after sending off warheads to every major city should be scary enough. But the T-1000 has very little lines and is just creepy enough to make twitch when you see him.

Sci-fi movies can rarely be made in such way that can be looked at as works of art. This is one of the few exceptions. The prediction of judgment day with Hamilton watching a playground full of kids be burnt to the ground is an absolute brilliant portrayal of Armageddon. The theme that men will destroy themselves is also shown throughout the movie also and is even said by The Terminator"" It's in your nature to destroy yourselves"". This brings the movie to a whole new level of sci-fi.

Overall, Termiantor II: Judgement Day is an absolute must see classic. If you have not seen it, buy it! Because once you have seen it, you will want to do so anyways. It is fast paced and highly enjoyable for just about every audience.

I highly recommend this movie."
27. Terminator 2: Judgment Day,10/10,Great action and much more,"The future John Connor has sent a T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to protect the teenage John Connor (Edward Furlong) from the most advanced Terminator ever, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). It's mimetic poly-alloy material allow it to mimic anything it touches. John must retrieve his mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from the psychiatric hospital.

The CG T-1000 is the most advanced FX of its times. For the rest, it is all real action. It still looks exciting and hasn't aged too badly. James Cameron has pushed the envelop to the limits. This is not simply Terminator on steroids. Cameron has added a lot of humor, and also heart. The T-101 is more a father figure to John Connor. And Sarah Connor's tough love really adds to the heartbreak. And the central idea that the future is still their's to create. All of it makes this more than a simple shoot 'em up movie. This is one of the best sequel ever.

27. Terminator 2: Judgment Day,9/10,One sequel that out does the original,"I am not a big fan of sequels,as most of them disappoint,but T2 certainly does not.In fact,it's a rare case,at least in my opinion, of a sequel actually surpassing the original film in terms of greatness.As in 99.9% of his films,Arnold Schwarzenegger is the good guy once again,but you don't mind once you witness the incredible villain performance of Robert Patrick.This film is nothing short of a beginning to end thrill ride.Let us not forget the talents of Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong,who gave great supporting efforts.Thumbs up!

27. Terminator 2: Judgment Day,10/10,THE Best Action Film Ever!,"'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' is THE Best Action Film Ever. I've seen this film numerous times, and it gets better each time I revisit it. James Cameron & Arnold Schwarzenegger have NEVER Been this Good!

'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' Synopsis: The cyborg who once tried to kill Sarah Connor must now protect her teenage son, John Connor, from an even more powerful and advanced Terminator.

'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' is Superb ENTERTAINMENT. Its so good, that everything works on its advantage. Be it the Script, Direction, Production-Value, Performances, Action/Stunts, Editing, Graphics or even the Music, everything is so darn good. Its truly amongst THE Finest Films of all-times.

James Cameron & William Wisher, Jr.'s Screenplay is Awesome. Cameron's Direction is Masterful. Graphics are Terrific. Editing, Cinematography, Production-Value, Music, everything is just Perfect.

Schwarzenegger is impeccable the Terminator, playing the unbeatable hero to the hilt. Robert Patrick as the T-1000, the villain, is brilliant. Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, is impressive. Edward Furlong as John Connor, is lovable.

On the whole, 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' Rocks! Its a Knock-Out!"
27. Terminator 2: Judgment Day,10/10,"Schwarzenegger's Best Film, Hands Down",
27. Terminator 2: Judgment Day,10/10,It pushes the limits of greatness,"Probably this is the movie I enjoyed watching the most. Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of my all time favorite actors, I am a huge fan of him. It does not matter whether his acting is great or not (but in this movie, he is great I think) The Terminator 2 has humor at times, but because of that again rather critics give one star low! However, humor in the movie is not to entertain audiences. Humor in this movie results from natural situations, it seems that Cameron does not put such moments for our entertainment like the third Terminator movie. And this humor does not ruin the seriousness and the dark tone of the movie. I can't think of a Terminator movie without Schwarzenegger. I have seen Terminator Salvation and yes, there was Arnold Schwarzenegger too, but CGI! (an awful idea) Terminator Salvation was OK, but not as a Terminator movie, as a post apocalyptic science fiction action. I want to say a few things more about Schwarzenegger. He was an icon by this character. Motorcycle, leather jacket, sunglasses and pump rifle. At this point, this is the most humanist, may be the only action movie ever! One of my favorite one liners is the movie is ''he will live.'' Connor tries to teach him not to kill people. Don't get me wrong, it does not mean that I don't like other action movies which do not give such a message, but this just makes the movie greater and deeper. By the way, Terminator 2 is also the deepest action movie ever. This is one of the movies that when you replace any of the actors, pieces don't fall into place. Schwarzenegger is like he was made for Terminator (and yes Conan too), Robert Patrick was made for T-100 (he was at his best in this movie, may be not for acting, but for performance) and Edward Furlong was made for John Connor. Honestly, personally it was impossible to believe that Nick Stahl is John Connor, I watched him like another character. Furlong portrays a very realistic rover portrait. As for Linda Hamilton, she was not made for Sarah Connor, but it is a big pleasure to watch her and for her acting, real very good. Musics always make me live nostalgia, great musics. Now, let's talk about the scenes. The atari center sequence is the first beyond great sequence. This movie is great entertainment, every time, it is a great pleasure to watch it. From the middle of 1990s till now, I watched the movie almost 50 times. I love the metal holes and then renew. How creative it is. As for visual effects, it is a touchstone, yes still. It is the greatest visual effects of all time to me, till 2012. Now, to me it became the second greatest. And I am sorry, I find the visual effects of T2 much more believable than Avatar. Yes I know, 3D, some other new technologies as well. but this is what I think. At a few moments, it is flawed like the scene they shoot at the face of Schwarzenegger, but no problem at all. Can you believe that this movie was made in 1991? I can't believe at all. That's why it is still a milestone. The chase sequence in the highway is beyond great too. Cameron raised the bar and I used to compare all the chase scenes with this one. Do you know another movie that in user comments, the titles which say the greatest action movie ever are innumerable? Almost everyone says the greatest action movie ever, the best action movie of all time, the greatest, the best... I will say the same thing. This is the greatest action movie of all time. The pump rifle using style of Terminator was getting my attention when I was a child. Still I like that. I just like gunfight scenes, not guns by the way. The hospital sequence is the third beyond great sequence, there are a lot of scenes that deserves cinema anthology in this movie. The coffee scene was incredible, every time makes me remember The Silver Surfer, we get lots of very interesting and brilliant moments like the shoot at head (not just in this sequence, throughout the whole movie) The Terminator is 10 out of 10, but T2 surpasses even that (you know I can't give 11 out of 10) Ohh By the way, I don't recommend you to watch the extended edition, if you are a first time viewer. There are three new scenes in this edition. The scene which Sarah hallucinates, to me a mediocre scene, the scene which T-100 tells Sarah and John where his chip is, an unnecessary scene and the scene which a kind of foreplay and talking between Tarissa and Miles while he works at desk, a cliché and a bit ridiculous scene. Returning to the movie, this is the best cat and mouse game movie with No Country for Old Men, it wouldn't be better. T-1000 is the most powerful, the most resistant (the most indestructible) villain ever! You think that he is terminated, but he is not, will he be terminated this time? The movie delivers such a feeling that I would define great success. Helicopter truck fight is great, another action sequence, I would call the kind of action in the movie metallic, not CGI action. By the way, mercury scene was one of the most shocking moments in the cinema history! Unbelievable, incredible. There is an unaccountable moment which it seems that Hulk was inspired from. Another moment recalls The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King etc. If you watched both movies, you understand what I mean. And T-1000 continues to execute his tricks, I was bowling over every time. This is a non stop action movie, but not shallow at all, not like pure action with no substance, in contrast the deepest action movie ever made."
27. Terminator 2: Judgment Day,10/10,There's a reason this is so appreciated,"Let it be said right away: There is at least one obvious issue with this. That doesn't have to include the fact that this is one of those sequels that are so much like the original that one could argue that it's partially a remake. What I'm referring to is that going by the first, it technically shouldn't exist. I am not aware of anyone who considers the predecessor of this to be the only film in this series(I've experienced many who, with good cause, deny there to be a third movie... heck, I am one of them), but I could see why there could be. However, if you look past that(and you ought to at least consider doing so, as this doesn't come off as one of those follow-ups released to cash in on an earlier success), you're in for an undeniably enjoyable and well-done cinematic experience. The plot is interesting and well-told. The pacing is solid. The acting is great from all, Patrick is an incredible addition, and neither Arnie nor Linda have forgotten how to portray their role. The action gets bigger, and still consists of fights, shootouts and car chases, all of which are marvelous and exciting, and never degenerates into stupidity. The guns are still impeccably well-chosen and handled. Really cool. The new concept or two herein are very smart and well-thought out. The science fiction remains well-done. This holds an appropriate amount and volume of self-irony over the title character(though I did not mind the seriousness of the previous silver screen effort). While some of the dark tone is maintained, it is less violent and disturbing than the 1984 piece. There is also no nudity(well, just about) or sexuality in this. I have more points against this, meanwhile, they all give stuff away, and this will remain a spoiler-free review. And even with them, it's hard to argue with the quality of this, even if you prefer The Terminator to it(and I do). I recommend this to any fan of sci-fi, intense scenes, James Cameron, the others who made this, and/or food for thought wrapped neatly in celluloid. 10/10"
27. Terminator 2: Judgment Day,9/10,Persistence Personified 2...,"He's as big as a shack, ready to attack, and he promised that he would be back; but the tables have turned, there are things he's relearned, and it's left him a little concerned; that a cyborg with sheen, who's increasingly mean, and more flexible, tougher and keen; will remove Sarah Connor, make her son a gonner, and claim the world for the machines.

An ontological, paradoxical and dystopian forecast of a future world that probably won't have time travel, but may well see machines used to ill affect - we are, after all, our own worst enemies.

An outstanding piece of film making that perpetually stands the test of time.

27. Terminator 2: Judgment Day,10/10,The most iconic Time Travel and AI Rebellion story with the greatest Action of all time.,"I know the action in The Terminator was also great. That tension and amazing chasing scenes were just revolutionary.

But I don't know how improved this much in this movie. In Terminator 2: Judgment Day you're experiencing the best action scenes of all time. This is the Die Hard level of action with chasing. I don't know what you think but I think it's still better than all those Mission Impossible's action sequences. And those are great by the way. But this isn't great, this is just beyond great at Action sequences.

Besides the great Action scenes with some revolutionary VFX, the storyline is just brilliant!

James Cameron just written the best Time Travel story. I don't think I experienced any Time Travel movie like this. How can you assume that this time travel thing could be possible? This movie makes you question about it.

When you're combine the whole story in your mind, you'll find one of the most brilliant storyline. It may feel like simple but I guarantee you, It's not at all. It's just too well written. Not only based on time travel of course. In my opinion after The Matrix, this is the second best AI Rebellion story."
27. Terminator 2: Judgment Day,10/10,"the best action film of all time, and NOT due to the CGI","Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers arthouse-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take a few sci-fi leaps of faith, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.

This is the finest action movie of all time. And, yet, believe it or not, it's not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with a $100 million budget (in 1991!), with multiple huge explosions, with thousands of bullets fired, and scores of stuntmen used.

This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and CG. Without the vision, this film would be nothing. Without the tools, this film would be nothing.

But, a little bit of background is due. This is the sequel to the Terminator (1984), whose premise was that a near-indestructible cyborg is sent by evil self-aware machines from the near future to destroy the mother-to-be of the military commander who would lead the humans to a victory over the machines. Oh, and this terminator machine would come from a time of war between men and machines which followed a nuclear exchange that left billions of people dead, first. In Terminator 2, John Connor (the commander-to-be) is about 12 years old, and his mother (Sarah) is feverishly trying to prepare him for his fate, even as she tries to stop the factors that will lead to the nuclear war and the entire terrible future that made all this necessary. The machines now send a superior, more intelligent, shape-shifting cyborg (T1000) into the past, to kill John himself. Meanwhile, future-John reprograms the ex-evil Terminator (T101) from the original film, and sends him into the past to PROTECT John against the T1000.

That's your basic plot. It does involve travel into the past, so it immediately presents a time-travel paradox which can't really be resolved. In order to even try watching this movie, you MUST LOOK PAST THE PARADOX. If you don't, this movie has zero credibility, and is not worth your time.

What happens after the two terminators appear in the past is a wild ride rife with macho action, dark reflection on the nature of man, and a few rays of hope, here and there. Schwarzenegger (the good terminator) and Patrick (the bad one) make for such effective foes that the times they meet on-screen are completely breathtaking (and odd, given that you repeatedly see the relatively slim T1000 through Arnie through a wall or two). Hamilton, as Sarah Connor, is a wonderful character -- tough beyond all belief and completely focussed on preventing the nuclear war and ensuring John's safety, yet clearly a little out of her mind with paranoia and anger; amazingly, you see actual character development (specifically, when John and T101 arrive at Dyson's house to prevent her from doing what she wants to) in her otherwise 2-dimensional character. And Furlong, as John, is not bad himself as the extroverted kid who's confused by the fact that everyone except his mom tell him his entire upbringing was based on a lie. The bit players all do their jobs well, particularly Earl Boen who plays the semi-sadistic mental hospital warden that stands between Sarah Connor and her son (until the T1000 makes a chilling entrance).

With these players set in motion, it's up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. (One often sees great performances in mediocre films... here the story transcends the performances -- an impressive feat.) The script delivers. The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments (I counted TEN all-star ones during my last viewing), and they're evenly spaced through the movie. I mean, who doesn't cheer (at least inside) when Arnold steps out of the biker bar, fully clad in leather when ""Bad to the Bone"" music starts to blast? The guy absolutely bleeds coolness. And the T1000 absolutely bleeds evil. But, with so many great moments, you'd think the pacing would be a little uneven... not really! The film shifts from place to place with an ease that makes perfect sense, never giving you the time to start being a little nitpicking jerk, always driving forward, but always doing so thoughtfully and with attention to detail.

Of course, this wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it, and it's perfectly done. The CG effects for the shape-shifting T1000 were cutting-edge for the time, and still look great (whoever said differently below is simply incorrect) -- even if they're completely commonplace today. The stunts are completely insane in scale (at one point, a helicopter flies under a highway overpass; at another, a motorcycle jumps from the 2nd floor of a building into a flying chopper). (Probably, only the Matrix and the Lord of the Rings movies compare in terms of the level of stunt insanity.) And the gunplay is delivered in perfect Cameron-Schwarzenegger style (as opposed to the slo-mo John Woo-style) -- you'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you'll see them used well. The film is violent, and somewhat bloody, but ALL of the mean-spirited violence is dealt by the evil characters, not the ones you root for (Quentin Tarantino fans: sorry). And then the truly amazing scenes that bypass acting are shocking and memorable -- just wait until the nuclear detonation sequence.

I'm not sure what else you would want in a movie. Probably moral content, and the movie has a very clear pro-human, anti-war message. The message is a bit stale, and the delivery IS, at times, a little heavy-handed (and some moments with the T101 seem just a bit unrealistic, towards the end), but the movie has heart, and that you cannot deny. Plus, it simply rocks. 10/10"

It surpasses the original in almost every way except the first film had a darker moodier atmosphere. But Terminator 2 has much much more, more character development, better acting strong direction, and THE most amazing visual effects ever!!! Cameron's and Schwarzenegger's best movie. A true classic. The Best!!!

27. Terminator 2: Judgment Day,10/10,A piece of cinematic genius...,
29. Django Unchained,10/10,"My favourite Tarantino, and that's a bold statement.","A German bounty hunter flees a Slave, Django, and the pair embark on a mission to find Django's wife.

As soon as I heard Luis Bacalov's Django, I was hooked.

This remains my favourite Tarantino film, and let's be fair there are many classics in that particular catalogue.

Django is equal parts shocking, entertaining, dramatic, bold, funny and original, to this day no other film exists that is remotely similar. It's a western, action packed love story, it really is a one off.

Three hours passed by effortlessly, it's one of those films where I wasn't aware of time passing by, I was engrossed and absorbed into it.

Some of the humour is hilarious, and in the context of the film works to perfection, the humour is as good, as the violence and misery of slavery are guy wrenching.

The music is absolutely wonderful, the perfect soundtrack accompanies this great film. Indeed the whole production is exemplary, it's a skilfully crafted film, the visuals are jaw dropping, it's very skillfully put together, with costumes, sets and lighting all on point, with the unbelievable staging as well.

Now I am sometimes quick to highlight who stands out in a film or TV series, but how can you do that here, every single performance is on point, Waltz, Foxx, DiCaprio, Jackson, I honestly don't think it gets better than this assembly of greats.

It's no wonder it gave us so many memes, who hasn't seen this masterpiece. If you haven't grab your remote, and improve your day.

10/10."
29. Django Unchained,9/10,Unmistakable Tarantino,"Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) is a bounty hunter. To identify his next catch, he tries to purchase Django (Jamie Foxx). Thing go all wrong Tarantino style. The two become friends and Dr Schultz decide on a plan to free Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from a notorious plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).

This is Quentin Tarantino all the way. His style has become as unique & original as they come. There is no mistaking it for another. It's the music, the violence, the visuals, the black humor, and the subject matter. This is all Tarantino. If there is one complain, it's the double climax. While I understand the need for a happy Hollywood ending, it would have been better to have 1 big gun fight and just finish with it. Not that big of a deal. Certainly it's still a great film.

29. Django Unchained,8/10,A Bountiful Tale...,"Django's luck, has taken quite a turn, the chains around his legs, have suddenly been spurned, Dr Schultz did him a favour, uncoupled him from viscous slavers, now they're off to see what bounties can be earned. The rewards are more enticing than plain cash, as they hunt down evil villains and watch them crash, their revolvers take them out, seldom having time to shout, it's akin to picking up, discarded trash. Now Django's keen to find his wife who's kept, by Calvin Candie who is cunningly adept, at keeping people tethered, disobey and they get leathered, but the duo plan to make an intercept.

Great performances, great dialogue and a bountiful tale set during the less celebratory times of a countries history.

29. Django Unchained,10/10,Tarantino at his best,"(Jamie Fox, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington, Walton Goggins, James Remar, Don Johnson, Bruce Dern & Samuel L. Jackson)

Set in the Wild West in Texas in 1858, a former dentist turned bounty hunter named Schultz stumbles upon the Speck Brothers who are in transit moving slaves they own. Schultz gets to talking with a slave named Django inquiring if he's heard of the Brittle brothers, upon affirmation of such information Schultz proceeds to purchase Django if he helps him locate and take care of the brothers than he would grant Django his freedom along with a horse and $75. Schultz then takes Django under his wing training him the ways of the bounty hunter and he becomes his deputy. After successfully tracking and taking out the Brittle Brothers and many other targets over the winter Django tells Schultz his story of how he and his wife attempted to escape their former owner and then were sold separately, and how he would like to use that reward to purchase his wife back. They discover the location of a Mississippi plantation where Broomhilda, his wife , was sold. They learn the ruthless Calvin Candie Von Shaft is the new owner and they now know that a scheme needs to be plotted to successfully purchase Broomhilda without raising suspicion that she was the target all along.

For a nearly three hour movie it certainly doesn't feel that way as the film is so action packed that it'll keep you on your toes the entire duration of the film. A beautifully produced piece of film that stacks up with every other great Tarantino film, it just fits the mold so perfectly. Well developed characters and a unique story like none other. So much originality has been missing in westerns i feel like this one fueled the next decade of great westerns that have been released. This long list of actors in this film is quite extraordinary as there was even more great actors i could have listed. The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal and I'll admit i listen to this frequently it just fit the film perfect. The dialog was written so nicely creating some iconic scenes. Anyone who truly loves film can not get enough of this Tarantino masterpiece."

29. Django Unchained,8/10,It's not perfect but it's very good... and I'm not even a fan of Tarantino!,"I just saw this film and I confess that I am completely satisfied. I am not an admirer of Tarantino but I have little to say about this film, inspired by a character from the sixties western-spaghetti films and mixing western with blacksploitation. Tarantino's style (exaggerated, showy, extravagant and excessive) is all there before us, but unlike other films I didn't feel that this was a problem or transformed the film into a kind of parody.

The plot is about the search that Django, a former slave who is unexpectedly released and becomes a bounty hunter, will do for his wife, a slave who was sold and disappeared. He has the help of a German, responsible for his release. Together they discover that she is at the home of a rude slave-owner called Cotton Candy who, among other businesses, profits from death fights between slaves. So they decide to disguise themselves as experts in the field to go to his plantation and try to buy her freedom without Candy realizing what they want.

The film is very good and, despite being almost three hours long, it has no dead moments and entertains wonderfully. However, although Tarantino's exaggerations and histrionic vision were not a problem this time, there are some points that were really uncomfortable, mainly concerning historical rigor, which, we already know, is not something that he really takes seriously (another reason why I don't like him as a director). To begin with, such Mandingo Fights never existed. We are not in Ancient Rome and the slave owners, however bad they were, did not like to throw money out the window and kill for pleasure their best pieces! Tarantino went to get that silly idea from another film he liked and pasted it here. Another problem is the use of dynamite, which would only be invented a few years after the period in which the film takes place. The clothes also do not match the time or place of the action. The outfit of the Club's black maid, with that miniskirt, is particularly bad in that it sexualizes the character and imports a 21st century scent into the middle of the 19th century. I will not go on much longer, I think I proved my point. Another thing I have to say is that this is a very violent film, Tarantino style, that is, with a ton of blood for each bullet, spectacular shootings, some nudity and high doses of brutality. The dialogues are also full of racist insults and profanity, but I think that was something the film asked for, in support of its own credibility. In short, this is not a movie for anyone. With Tarantino, this is often taken for granted.

The main role was given to Jamie Foxx, and he is superb and gives the character a strength and toughness that I liked, and which contrast nicely with the polite sensitivity of Dr. Schultz, brilliantly played by Christopher Waltz. This actor had already done an extraordinary job in ""Inglorious Bastards"" and now he was even better, with a character that seems tailor-made for him. I was particularly impressed with the work of Leonardo Di Caprio, who rarely manages to make villains. He is an actor with a rare talent and has managed to be worthy of our contempt in this film. Another actor who shines in this film is the veteran Samuel L. Jackson, in the role of a black butler so fond of the owner that he becomes more slavish than whites. I also liked the brief cameo of honor of Franco Nero, the actor who played Django in the original films. It was an elegant and honorable way for Tarantino to bow to the actor and the work that inspired him. Much less impressive was the performance of Kerry Washington, who has little time and material to show what is worth.

Technically, it is a film full of notable aspects that require our attention and that, to a large extent, are part of the director's brand image. It is the case of cinematography and the use of strong colors and slow motion footage in action scenes, features of a strong visual style that Tarantino loves. The sets are good, and also the costumes despite the anachronisms that I have mentioned. The film has a pleasant pace, but the first half was generally better yet more restrained: it seems that Tarantino gets lost in his own style as he approaches the most violent scenes. The soundtrack is great and takes advantage of several songs by various composers. Personally, I enjoyed listening to the original song from ""Django"" by Luis Bacalov, and the songs composed for this film by Ennio Morricone, a name that will always be associated, in collective memory, with the great western-spaghetti of the past. It was a careful, effective and honorable selection in the way it honors the genre."

29. Django Unchained,8/10,Great film with the crazy passion of a great director,
29. Django Unchained,8/10,"Brutally hilarious and quite messy, but a total blast from start to finish","I only had one thought on my mind for this Christmas: see Django Unchained. Quentin Tarantino's latest opus, a Western set two years before the Civil War, concerns a former slave named Django (Jamie Foxx). He is freed by bounty hunter Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz) in order to help him with a bounty. Quite quickly, Shultz takes Django under his wing and trains him as his partner. But he made him a promise: that he would rescue his wife from a plantation owned by the ruthless Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). And rescuing her is not going to be all that easy.

What pains me the most about Django Unchained, as a die-hard Tarantino fan, is just how sloppy it all seems. I enjoyed every minute of it, but I could never shake the feeling of how messy and thrown together it all feels. Portions of the film feel episodic (the search for the Brittle Brothers, mentioned heavily in the trailers, begins and ends practically within minutes), and some scenes just seem to play out just for the fun of it. Another scene from the trailers involving a lynch mob with bags covering their faces seems added for comedic purposes, and has no real point of actually existing. More than any of his films before it, Django feels like Tarantino simply making a movie for sheer pleasure and with no outside motivations or controllers.

The film threatens to go totally off the rails at any given moment, and lacks any real sense of direction or focus. It may sound ridiculous, but the loss of editor Sally Menke confirms a sneaking suspicion I always had about Tarantino – he needed a steady right hand to help encourage him as to what was needed and what was not. I do not want to criticize Django's editor Fred Raskin, but it is obvious he is no Menke and that works against the film heavily. It lacks the polish we have come to expect, and is practically stripped of the glossy/cool texture so prevalent in Tarantino's work up until now.

But then maybe that was his intention all along, and perhaps Tarantino is airing out his frustrations with life and film in general. Django is deliberately shot on film (or at least from the print I saw), and looks very gritty and messy at all times. It is significantly more brutally violent than anything he has worked on before (the borderline cartoonish Kill Bill included), and has a very go for broke attitude about itself. The film seems to revel in how brilliantly it can splatter all the blood and gore (done through the use of squibs and no digital!), and how uncomfortably numbing it can make the violence. I know he does not care what people think of his films, but this movie especially seems like an emphatically raised middle finger to the establishment. And for all of my complaints about how messy it all feels, I was never once bored or felt like the movie was dragging itself out. The staggering 165-minute running time shockingly flies by faster than you might ever imagine.

Acting wise, Tarantino stacks the deck with a number of recognizable character actors young and old for roles that vary in size. Most have very few lines, if any at all, and seem to just stand by, just as content as the audience is to watch the action unfold. It is a little off-putting, especially with how important some of these characters are initially made out to be. Washington as Broomhilda von Shaft (one of the most subtle references he's ever dropped) does well as the helpless victim and frequent dreamlike object – but she never really gets to show off any of her acting prowess outside of her facial reactions. They are increasingly effective, especially during horrific flashback scenes. But her work here feels ridiculously stunted in comparison to the other leads. Samuel L. Jackson, much like Tarantino himself, seems to just be having fun in his role as Candie's adviser Stephen. He plays on every ridiculous stereotype he ever has been associated with and then amps it up to a near ludicrous state. He is frequently hilarious, but the role seems to border on parody more than anything else.

Surprisingly, Foxx takes a very long time settling into the leading role. It may just be the character, but it is quite clear from the on- set that he is not very comfortable in Django's shoes, and leads credence to why Will Smith, amongst so many others, dropped out of the picture so quickly. But once he finds his footing, he does a fantastic job walking the thin line between empathetic and sadistic. It is not an easy character to play, but Foxx makes it his own, bringing a sense of style and grace that are virtually absent from the rest of the film. And of course, he gets all the best lines.

Waltz and DiCaprio are the clear standouts however, nailing every nuance of their sadly underwritten characters. While Waltz plays the straight man, DiCaprio is delightfully unhinged and vicious. Both are playing directly against type, yet are strangely comfortable in the roles. Watching them act circles around the rest of the cast, Foxx included, is the true highlight of the film. I just wish they were both given additional emphasis and more to do.

For all of its numerous faults, I had a blast watching Django Unchained. It is hilarious, it is a lot of fun, and is wildly enjoyable. I genuinely think it could have been a lot better if there was more focus and direction, but this is very clearly a picture Tarantino wanted to make on his own terms. And for that, I applaud him for the effort. It is not his best work, but certainly not his worst.

8/10."
29. Django Unchained,9/10,I like the way you write Quentin!,"This is a fun movie! Great acting, great soundtrack, great editing and great story! The scenes in the big house...top class! Every scene with Leonardo diCaprio was amazing! Now my problems with the movie: the main meat of the movie, the mid section, dragged on a little too long and some of the dialogue was a bit dull but it was necessary to tell the story. The opening of the movie though, was great, I was hooked instantly and the end was so chaotic and fast paced! I wasn't expecting this movie to be as hilarious as it was either, so many scenes had the timing of humour spot on and actually made me laugh out loud. The story isn't complicated or hard to follow which is good, I enjoyed being able to relax and watch the movie unfold. I like this...9/10.

29. Django Unchained,9/10,A masterpiece!,"Django Unchained is a 2012 Hollywood movie depicting the story of a former slave turned freeman who just wants to get his wife back. He will stop at nothing to unite with his wife.

A brilliant masterpiece of a movie. The gut-wrenching way in which slavery in past-America is depicted is simply awe-inspiring. Quentin Tarantino goes all out to show the viewers what slavery was like in those days.

Every character in the movie were aptly cast and put on a splendid show. Every scene with Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz is memorable and impressionable.

All in all, this is a Tarantino movie. So, you gotta watch it. A revenge story so good that it will stir up your insides!

29. Django Unchained,8/10,Who's that stumblin' around in the dark? State your business or prepare to get winged!,"Tarantino's first western film sees him return with a lot of the usual Hallmarks that are associated with him as an auteur. This film is heavy on violence with lots of gunplay and fighting, and it is filled with plenty of dialogue which drives the story as much as the action. Like some of his other films there is also a theme of vengeance running through it, something that was explored a little in ""Inglourious Basterds"" by Shosanna and the American-Jewish commandos; in ""Death Proof"" by the surviving women; sort of in ""Jackie Brown"", ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" too. This time out though, the main vengeance is between a freed slave and slavers in the 1850's wild west.

Christoph Waltz plays Dentist/Bounty Hunter Dr King Schultz, who frees a slave called Django (Jamie Foxx), who will help him find some outlaws he has been tracking for a bounty. Django has his own plans though and wants vengeance against the racial injustices that are rife, and primarily to find his wife Broomhilda von Shaft. They learn that she is being held as a slave at the Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) ""Candyland"" plantation in Mississippi. On route to Mississippi, Django learns all about bounty hunting from working with Schultz and they develop a mutual respect for one and other.

Although Jamie Foxx was not the first name out of the hat when Tarantino went into casting, he delivers a great performance as Django. As his story arc develops, he gives the role some excellent character and strength which I liked, which contrasted nicely with Waltz's more polite and sensitive character. Django and Schultz have a good chemistry that works well in tandem, one being gritty and raw, and the other being quieter and more reserved. One being about action now, and the other being more of a planner. Both manage to learn from each other as the story progresses and, in a sense, this becomes a bit of a buddy road trip (on horseback) film. In Tarantino's last film ""Inglourious Basterds"" I felt that Waltz's performance was one of the standouts, and this film he continues that level of acting once more. I do not prefer one of the roles over the other, they are both equally on par here.

The pantomime villain of the film is DiCaprio's Calvin Candie. On the surface a well-mannered southern gentleman, despite obviously being a slaver and dictator in his own kingdom. This performance caught me off guard slightly and the usual lovable DiCaprio was able to turn on the offensive as easy as turning on a light switch. One minute he was being presented as calm and jovial, the next minute displaying a mean as hell psychopath willing to risk everything. Tarantino had wanted to work with DiCaprio for a while, even try to get him for a role in ""Inglourious Basterds"", so in ""Django Unchained"" he finally got his man.

I must mention Samuel L. Jackson's performance in this, he was incredible. He made my skin crawl and was a genuinely haunting character. He felt as much a bad guy as Calvin Candie was. In learning to survive and the way he adapted to do so for a better lifestyle he become corrupted. This corruption was not just the way he was and acted, but also the way he looked, his mannerism, everything about the performance gave me shudders.

Dealing with a film that looks at a dark time in humanities history is always going to invoke ill feelings and this certainly does that. Tarantino's film here is of course highly stylized and not entirely historically accurate in certain parts, but the main topic of slavery is something that cannot be denied. While ""Mandingo"" fights might not be accurate, or the wardrobe being display is not always correct for its time, the atrocity of slavery did of course exist and was mainstream in certain parts of America. While Tarantino handles this topic, and the linguistics unabashedly, certain audiences and critics did not respond well to it. While some audiences and critics have said it is offensive to them and handles racial issues terribly, equally the film has received praise from some quarters for the way it authentically handled these things. In this sense, the film does and will divide perceptions and will not make everybody happy or comfortable. In his own justification, Tarantino wanted to do a film which featured the history that America is ashamed to deal with, and which other countries directors feel they do not have a right to deal with.

This highly stylized western film is tribute to Spaghetti Westerns of the 1960's and 1970's, three of which Tarantino openly admitted he paid homage to in making ""Django Unchained"". Sergio Corbucci's 1966 ""Django"" and his 1968 ""The Great Silence"", and Richard Fleischer's 1975 ""Mandingo. The ""Unchained"" part of the title may pay tribute to the likes of Corbucci's 1966 ""Hercules Unchained"", or Lee Madden's 1970's ""Angel Unchained"" which is a revenge film against rednecks. Lots of doffs of the cap to Corbucci but then when Tarantino wrote this film he had just finished a book on Corbucci overlap isn't all that surprising. Furthermore, Corbucci makes a cameo in the film too, which further shows Tarantino's admiration for the Italian filmmaker.

I enjoyed this film more than I though I was going to. After ""Inglourious Basterds"" I expected another visually strong film, but one which was a bit messy and unintelligent. In this I got an exciting film that despite its nearly 3-hour runtime it did not feel like it dragged and still offered plenty of twists and turns. It might not have handled certain racial elements well, and I cannot think it did anything for gender politics either the way that women appear only as damsels in distress. But none the less it offered good writing with lots of strong dialogue. The onscreen bromance between Foxx and Waltz was endearing and fun, and DiCaprio's character gave me a somebody to ""boo"" and ""hiss"" at. Add to the writing and the performances some lovely cinematography and well-choreographed scenes, and this film does feel like a modern spaghetti western that is full of grit and style. 8 out of 10."
29. Django Unchained,10/10,Perfect spaghetti magic,
29. Django Unchained,10/10,Tarantino-gasm!,
29. Django Unchained,9/10,Beautiful and violent,"Sometimes the German equivalent of the MPAA can surprise us all. Not only did this movie get a rating (uncut), it also passed with a ""16"". I'm always happy, when they pass a movie uncut, so I won't complain. That doesn't mean, I'm not wondering what is going on in the heads of some of those people who decide what rating a movie gets. The movie even got some heat in America for its violence (then again it also got some heat, because of its male lead. One party decided it wasn't a good example for white people to be killed by a black guy, the other side thought it was unfair in its depiction of black people and so forth)! Saying it lead to people becoming violent(?).

Apart from those discussions, what can be said, is that Tarantino did it again. A great movie, with superb performances by everyone involved. Who'd have thought Kerry Washington would have to learn German for a role? Not me, but the inclusion of Waltz, Tarantino favorite and rightfully so, made this happen. And while Waltz almost steals the movie, it's still very much a Jamie Foxx picture."
29. Django Unchained,8/10,"Over indulgent, gross....but also terrific.","My biggest complaints about ""Django Unchained"" are ones that really won't matter to most people who see this film. After all, just about everyone knows that Quentin Tarantino's films are incredibly bloody, gross and self-indulgent. So, when you see a billion gallons of blood and bodies flying everywhere, you are not really surprised! This one does go a step further--there is some full-frontal male nudity and a few of the scenes were so gross and gratuitous that Tarantino has outdone himself. But still, you KNOW ahead of time that this is not a film to show your mother, Father Jenkins or your 6 year-old!! However, HOW far it goes will limit the film's appeal--you can be sure of that. Evan a large number of adults would be unable to stick with this one...it's THAT violent.

The film is, in some ways, like an Italian western. I loved that much of the music was done by Ennio Merricone--the same guy who did music for such classic spaghetti westerns as ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" and ""Once Upon a Time in the West"". It was a major plus. I also liked seeing that one of the many wonderful cameos was by Franco Nero--the original Django. But, if you think that this is a modern Hollywood version of an Italian western, you are mistaken. PARTS of it are--most is not. In fact, despite the western clothing on so many of the characters (anachronistic, actually), the film is mostly set in the American South just before the Civil War. People just didn't dress that way at that time and in that place. The film is, at times, sort of like a blaxspoitation western in style as well.

What did I like about the film? Well, it was never, ever dull. The film never really gives you a chance--even though it clocks in at 2 hours and 45 minutes. Second, as I mentioned above, there were a lot of cool cameos--and some were real surprises, such as Tom Wopat and Bruce Dern! Third, although it was vile, the language was dead on--no politically corrected phraseology in this one! Nasty and blunt, that's for sure. Fourth, although it was really violent and gross, I will admit that there is something very satisfying in seeing all these racist jerks killed so violently. It appeals to the lowest instinct in us...but on a primal level is IS appealing. Finally, the acting was quite good.

What didn't I like? Well, even for a Tarantino film it was violent---very violent. Also, I definitely agree that the first hour or so of the film was MUCH better. It was better paced, less indulgent and more enjoyable. The film did become a bit of a free-for-all blood-fest near the end and the 'mandingo fighting scene' was unnecessarily nasty. Still, if you have the stomach for it, ""Django Unchained"" is a heck of an enjoyable film.

By the way, I did a little research and there appears to be no such thing as 'mandingo fighting'. This was made up for this film."
29. Django Unchained,10/10,Best of Tarantino's movies so far,"Just like that. I watched this movie maybe 7 or 8 times, and never bored me.

The duo Jamie Fox and Christopher Waltz is incredibile, as well as Leonardo Di Caprio's interpretation. But every actress and actor in this movie did a top notch work.

Samuel L. Jackson role too was very difficult, and he did an astonishing performance.

Cinematography is incredible, soundtrack is perfect.

This is a masterpiece on every aspect.

29. Django Unchained,10/10,Brace yourself for True Tarantino,"Quentin Tarantino's 8th film ""Django Unchained"" is one hell of a movie. A brutal, bloody, terrifying, hilarious and awe-inspiring western disguised as a buddy movie that is so great that if John Wayne and Sergio Leone were alive now, they would've approve of this movie. It's designed to shock you, polarize you, test you and maybe even surprise you. But let me clear on this: If you are not a fan of bloody violence and the running length of 165 minutes, see a shorter movie. But if you love to see what Tarantino can do with movies like this, then you're in for a treat. Set during slavery in 1858, the movie follows Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave who is found by a bounty hunter disguised as a dentist named Dr. King Schultz (The always reliable Christoph Waltz) who hires him as a bounty hunter and a free man to find the Brittle Brothers. After finding them and hunting them down at a plantation run by Big Daddy (a remarkable Don Johnson), they relax for the winter only for them to go on a mission to find and rescue Django's wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) who is owned by Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) a man who runs a plantation known as Candieland. He even has a renegade slave as a servant named Stephen (A nearly recognizable Samuel L. Jackson, hidden in makeup and some prosthetics), who will have a part to play in the last half of the movie. I think Quentin Tarantino has outdone himself once again. Being in the filmmaking game for 20 years now, you can't deny and even reject his style in what he is bringing to the screen (He also has a cameo in here as well). His dialogue is like reading a book that grabs you and makes you want to know what happens next. The look and scope of the film is magnificent, thanks to a brilliant Oscar-winning cinematographer Robert Richardson and the late production designer J. Michael Riva. The performances in this film are brilliant. Having won an Oscar for ""Ray"", Jamie Foxx continues with his breathtaking performances that wows us. Here as Django, he is certainly fearless, baring his soul (and body) playing a man who is free from slavery, but can't be free by the rules and limitations of slavery. Christoph Waltz looks like he was born to be a part of Tarantino's entourage after his Oscar-winning performance for ""Inglorious Basterds"". Here, once again he brings humor and vulnerability to Dr. King Schultz. Never before have I ever seen an actor go that far and doesn't go over-the-top like Leonardo DiCaprio. As Calvin Candie, DiCaprio is certainly Oscar-worthy as a man who runs a tight ship by running a place where male slaves fight to the death and female slaves are being prostitutes and he seems to be the kind of guy to like even though he is a villain and he speaks Tarantino's dialogue like a pro. When he has a scene in which he reveals three dimples from a skull that belongs to his father, he is literally terrifying. Kerry Washington is superb as Broomhilda and Samuel L. Jackson is the real scene-stealer. The supporting cast is great from Walton Goggins, Jonah Hill, Michael Bacall, Michael Parks, James Remar, Robert Carradine to a small cameo by Franco Nero. ""Django Unchained"" has a lot of things to say about slavery and how cruel it is. But at the same time, it provides the fact that if Tarantino rearranged history by shooting Adolf Hitler to a pulp while everything blows up at a movie theater, he can do it again by having a former slave whipping a man who used to beat him and his wife. Now, that's entertainment. This movie really is off the chain. It's not only one of the most captivating films of the year, it's one of the best films of the year. Go see it, it will be worth your time. Keep in mind though, there are characters, especially Django, Stephen, Candie and Schultz that uses the N-word numerous times in this movie. That seems relevant to the time period, don't ya think?"

30. Forrest Gump,10/10,Let's see the world through the eyes of Forrest Gump,"""I've made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty good""-Tom Hanks.

""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies of all time, guaranteed. I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart. The performances are just so unforgettable and never get out of your head. The characters, I mean the actors turned into them and that's what got to me. The lines are so memorable, touching, and sometimes hilarious.

We have Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks), not the sharpest tool in the box, his I.Q. is right below the average scores. But his mama(Sally Field) believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there's nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice ""You can sit here if you want"". Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's ""always kissing and touching her and her sisters"". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.

Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest ""Run, Forrest! Run!"". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.

Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.

This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.

10/10"
30. Forrest Gump,10/10,"In my opinion, no film has touched me more than this one.....","Quite simply, the greatest film ever made.

Humour, sadness, action, drama and a Vietnam film all rolled into one.

I'm not a stone cold, heartless villain, but it takes a lot to make me cry when I watch a movie. Bambi's mother, I couldn't care less. Jimmy Stewart in, ""Oh, what a wonderful life,"" - yeah right! The Lion King, when Mufasa bites the big one - on the verge.

But seriously - I bawled my big brown eyes out, on several occasions in this film. A real tear-jerker, and a wonderful character, played to perfection by Tom Hanks. Every bit as worthy for the Oscar as Rooney was to win the Premiership in 2007.

I cannot say it enough: This is THE film of all time. Watch it, and you'll see.

30. Forrest Gump,10/10,Pure Charm,"Every once in a while, something comes along that hasn't been done before. This movie is one of those things. First of all, we have a principal character whose take on life is one where you don't judge it; you live it. I know he's a film character. It doesn't matter because we use images such as these to inspire us and to give us our own way of treating each day. Forrest lets no grass grow under his feet. He is the consummate optimist. He doesn't complain because he sees early on that it does you no good. His life is one adventure after another, in and out of the public eye, but his shyness and demeanor don't ever get to his head. He is the epitome of patience, something sadly lacking in the lives of most Americans. He is pushed around by the gusts of time and always lands on his feet. His relationship with a troubled girl is the one consistent thing in his life, and that is also shows his pugnaciousness. There are some commentators and reviewers who call this character stupid. He is a slow processor, but his stability lies in his morality and his consistency. His mother raised him well.

Tom Hanks has become our new Jimmy Stewart. His roles are about human emotion and dedication. He is the everyman in many ways. Obviously, the subject matter has changed, but you can bank on his decision making when it comes to film.

The other heroes are the special effects people. They are able to make this work; to create an incredible world for him to function within. The news clips are quite marvelous. I usually put this film in my top ten."
30. Forrest Gump,9/10,Dropping My Keys,"I remember John Byner, the stand-up comic and impressionist of the 1970s talking about guys crying at movies, how it's not an acceptable behavior. He advised the men in his audience to drop their keys, do something that gets them to lean forward, wipe their faces, and get things under control.

I dropped my keys watching Forrest Gump. Lieutenant Dan comes over the hill at Forrest and Jenny's wedding, new legs, fiancé at his side, clean-cut and happy.

Forrest states the obvious, ""Lieutenant Dan, you gawt le-eggs!""

And the water-works just started to flow.

I sit up straight and clear my throat. Got 'em (the keys, that is). My wife leans over and gives me a kiss. She says, ""That's why I love you.""

Other than a few historical fussinesses and plot slickeries, none of which are worth mentioning, this is as close to a perfect, emotionally-satisfying entertainment as I have ever seen.

I love this movie. I never tire of the simple story of the guy with the lowest IQ in the room being the smartest guy in the room. It's filled with a patriotic decency you can only find in The Wizard of Oz and To Kill a Mockingbird.

When Dorothy is aching for home and the Wizard can't deliver, I drop my keys. When Scout points to the man behind Jem's bedroom door and says, ""Hey, Boo,"" the fob goes flying.

The next time I get out my copy to show to my 11th Grade US History kids, I'll start fingering my key chain.

I can't help it."
30. Forrest Gump,10/10,A beautiful fable for now and the future,"I believe everyone has a right to their opinion about films or other topics. However from a lot of the comments I have read about this film, I do not think many got the gist of the message from the author and the film maker. This film is a great modern fable, a fable in the dictionary is defined as a brief fictitious story that teaches a moral. There are many morals defined in this film but foremost is integrity and a simple goodness.

I have a half brother who grew up in the Southern U.S. and on one occasion we were discussing this film and he said he felt it portrayed Southerners as dimwitted. I disagreed with him and informed him that the author himself was a native Southerner. The setting is central to this story in that it lets the tale unfold tying in factual events with the fable before us.

The film is wonderfully directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film is his opus and is acted by a great cast on all levels. From the children who were Forrest Gump and Gump Jr. by Haley Joel Osment. Say what you want but I feel Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar award. Gary Sinise is synonymous with Lt.Dan whenever you hear those words. Sally Fields is the loving dutiful mother in her challenging situation. Mykelti Williamson as Bubba gives you a real sense in the story that Gump had a genuine friend, he moves you with his character. Words don't grasp the full performance of Robin Wright Penn as Jenny. Jennys' tenderness and pain are palpable as exhibited by Wright.

I feel that much of Gumps' appeal is his downright sense of doing the right thing regardless of the people and situations around him and we see that in this film. That being the case maybe we all wish we could be just a little more like that, trying to maintain innate goodness and not the trade-offs we often make as we go down lifes highways.

The movie has it all too,drama,comedy and it challenges societal norms as well. Then there are the almost endless quotes from the movie that have slipped into everyday speech. They are too numerous to say at this point.One of the toppers for me in the movie is when Forrest is in a quandary about life and wondering as Lt.Dan said we all have a destiny and his Mom says it is where we are all just floating around like a feather in the wind. Forrest's character terms it very well with this quote,""I think it is a little bit of both."" From my experiences in life it does appear to be that way. So if you have not seen the movie,see it soon you are in for a real treat. If you did not like it, give it a try again and hopefully you will see it for the great story it is!"
30. Forrest Gump,10/10,Forrest Gump is a movie masterpiece that won't be forgotten and will continue to inspire,"He may have been good in Philadelphia but be is excellent in Forrest Gump.Tom Hanks delivers another great performance in his career by portraying the lovable,king yet not so intelligent character Forrest Gump.It is also Tom Hanks' second straight win for the Best Actor Oscar which he becomes the second man to do said accomplishment after Spencer Tracy.Whilst not as dramatic as Philadelphia,Tom Hanks' performance is just as great in this movie and this movie could possibly be the film of Tom Hanks' career as he used to be a comedy guy who turned to drama in a way which would paved for future stars such as Jim Carrey(The Truman Show),Reese Witherspoon(Walk the Line) and Will Ferrell(Stranger Than Fiction) to name a few.Also staring in this great movie classic are Robin Wright-Penn who plays Jenny,Gary Sinise who was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Lieutenant Dan Taylor,Mykelti Williamson as Forrest's best friend and shrimper Benjamin Buford""Bubba"" Blue and Sally Field as Mrs.Gump.This film was nominated for a total of thirteen Academy Awards but won six of them which include Best Film Editing,Best Visual Effects,Best Adapted Screenplay,Best Picture,Best Director-Robert Zemeckis and Best Actor-Tom Hanks.This is one masterpiece of a movie that will not be forgotten about in a long time.Bravo!"
30. Forrest Gump,10/10,Purity and innocence retained,"I have seen this movie easily a half a dozen times, and I find that the beauty of the film is how Forrest Gump not only shares his innocence and purity with others, including the audience, he also manages to retain that innocence and purity through some very difficult times. As a Viet Nam veteran, and a college graduate of the late Sixties, I could of course personally relate to the various periods that Forrest Gump endures. I would only mention that the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and period costume was enthralling. And yet it was so perfectly understated that Forrest Gump's travels through thirty five years of the stormiest and most meaningful years of American history only became clearly defined for the viewer. Even more so than the well known chocolates quote as a metaphor for life, I felt that the remark that stupid is what you do is probably more workable for most of us.

30. Forrest Gump,10/10,Contemporary classic: one of my all-time faves,
30. Forrest Gump,10/10,The role of innocence in positive thinking and thus success ...,"... seems to be the theme of this film. Forrest Gump has an IQ of 70, is being raised by a single mom, lives in a remote part of the Deep South where there are few opportunities, and has legs that require that he wear braces as a child. Sounds like the recipe for a sad tale or at least a slow death from mediocrity right? No, instead, because Forrest isn't really bright enough to realize the situation he is in, he simply does what he's told to do or what occurs to him to be the right thing at the time and succeeds due to a lack of self doubt. He's told to run and he becomes the star of the Crimson Tide and an All American. When recovering from a war wound, he's taught ping-pong and winds up competing at the global level in China itself. He promises his dying friend Bubba that he'll go ahead with their plans and become a shrimp boat captain and his brand of seafood products becomes a household name.All along the way he never learns the lessons in life that tend to make the rest of us cynical.

Gump's childhood sweetheart Jenny starts out with high aspirations - she wants to be like Joan Baez and fight for world peace - and instead she winds up disillusioned, drug addicted, and a near suicide before age 30. She doesn't have Forrest's childlike innocence and this leads her to self-doubt and ultimately failure. Also, fate or ""destiny"" as the film calls it, is not on her side in one big way - her own father molested her as a child, which couldn't help but play a role in the decisions she made.

Now Gump does have a bunch of coincidences on his side - call it destiny if you will - the storm that beaches every shrimping vessel in the Gulf of Mexico but his, for example - but in most cases this is just the story of a man going through life without self doubt and that little voice that tells the rest of us ""You can't do that! What are the odds! You'll fail! Make the safe choice!"" To me, this is what this film is about. I think everyone sees something different in it. I highly recommend it as it is truly one of a kind. I remember when it came out it absolutely made professional reviewers crazy that people liked this film, probably because they didn't understand it."
30. Forrest Gump,10/10,"Thirty years on, and it's still as wonderful.","A very eventful time in America's history, seen through the eyes of one man, Forest Gump, a man who has a very low IQ, a score of just 75.

Tom Hanks, we all know just how good an actor he is, but there is something about his performances here that's extra special, he is simply outstanding. He's given many great performances over the years, this has always stood out.

Forest sees Vietnam, the moon landings, presidential changes, and experiences a tough childhood and army life, all relayed from a public bench.

It's funny, it's moving, it's wonderfully quirky. I have always loved the way they placed him into historical footage, that scene with John Lennon a personal favourite. It's a long film, but it's one that simply flies by.

The music is fabulous throughout, some of the best, and most memorable songs of the time, you'll hear the likes of The Mamas and Papas, Scott McKenzie and many more, it's a terrific soundtrack.

I saw it aged 14 when it was first released, and maybe didn't appreciate it at the time, now though, I think it's a captivating watch.

Keep on running Forest.

10/10."
30. Forrest Gump,10/10,Tom Hanks delivers an astounding performance as Forrest Gump.,

30. Forrest Gump,10/10,Encapsulating...,"... all that is, all that was and all that will ever be, through the life experiences of the titular character performed to perfection by Tom Hanks whose generous performance leaves us humbled and in awe of what we can achieve, how we can achieve it and why we would want that achievement in the first instance. A piece of cinematic storytelling that will perpetually resonate no matter who or what you are, where you are going or who you are going with - timeless.

30. Forrest Gump,10/10,Quite possibly the best movie ever made.,"I've seen most of the top-voted 30 or 40 movies here at IMDb, and Forrest Gump probably wins my vote for the single best movie ever made.

This is not a conclusion I came to the first time I saw this film, or the second. The more you understand about this movie, the more you like it. And in terms of understanding it, my wife and I both were still gaining new understanding the 5th or 6th time we watched it. (For example: Why does Jenny behave exactly as she does throughout the movie? It'll take a lot of thinking to =fully= understand her.)

Just the fact that we've seen it at least half a dozen times says a lot. There are few movies that I ever even give a second viewing.

Like many of the truly good movies, there are people out there who see it once and consider it to be a waste of time. Such people are usually just looking for the most ""action,"" gore and sex they can find, and haven't a clue about films that actually involve thought, ideas, and life.

Did I mention the script is absolutely brilliant? There are a lot of =truly= funny moments. And the music rocks. But those are only specific aspects of a movie that has just about everything else right about it as well.

See it, enjoy it, think about it, see it again. Think about it some more. Forrest Gump is one of the greatest movies -- if not THE greatest -- ever made."
30. Forrest Gump,10/10,Mama said ...,"Take this with a grain of salt and don't be mad about certain things. Like one of the first flashbacks to the very beginning that does not come over preachy when it talks about the Klan (Ku Klux Klan that is, just in case you think I'm talking about any other Klan). Maybe sometime in the near future there will be a disclaimer and someone giving this context. But until then, you have to be educated enough yourself to understand and comprehend certain things. And you have to have a certain sense of humor to dig all the coincidences that Gump comes across at. It's alike a marathon through many landmarks of the short US history we have behind us. Like the Watergate scandal, Vietnam War, Black Panthers and so much more.

If you can dig all that and go with the flow, than the chocolate box this opens up for you, will taste quite delicious. It had been quite a while since I saw this the first time, but it still worked its charme to say the least. Great movie, great actors - you have to be in the right mind set and mood though. And be able to forgive certain things ..."
30. Forrest Gump,10/10,The Hand Of An Unseen Providence,"When Tom Hanks won his first Oscar for Philadelphia in 1993 the film received a total of five nominations. His second Oscar for Forrest Gump came in a film that received more than double that in nominations and awards. If Forrest Gump did nothing else it solidified Hanks's credentials as a serious actor. He would never be doing imitations of his Bosom Buddies character in films again.

It also among other awards also won for Best Picture and Best director for Robert Zemeckis, richly deserved. The film is Huckleberry Finn like in its canny observations coming from the man who had an IQ we are told of 75. But as Forrest also tells us, ""stupid is as stupid does"". And Forrest with the hand of an unseen providence comes out a lot better than some of the clever people he meets in life.

Watching the film once again it occurred to me that Mark Twain if he couldn't have written this himself would have loved the way Zemeckis handled the character of Forrest Gump. The beauty of Huckleberry Finn and the secret of its success is that Twain got into the mind of a child who recorded all the events around him, a child without too much education. What Zemeckis did was get Hanks into a child like mind who sees things with amazing clarity stripped of any veneer of pretense. Which Hanks observes in the people around him and in the events that shape America and himself from Eisenhower to Reagan.

There are two prominent female parts in Forrest Gump. One is for Robin Wright who plays the abused child Julie as an adult. She is Forrest's love and best friend and she takes a different path of life one she chose with more deliberation than Hanks. Their fates though eventually entwined are radically different.

The second major female role is for another two time Oscar winner Sally Field who now is playing matronly parts, a far cry from Gidget and the Flying Nun. She gives Forrest the maxims he lives by and in a crisis they turn out to be more than sound bite clichés.

Another award that Forrest Gump won is for Special Effects and an award it didn't win was for Gary Sinise in the role of Lieutenant Dan Taylor, Forrest's commanding officer in Vietnam. That's something that does not compute because the special effects were to show Gary Sinise as a double amputee with both legs lost in Vietnam.

It's some amazing bit of work no doubt about it, but to honor it without Sinise whose performance really brings it off is ridiculous. Sinise is the educated one who curses the fate that happened to him, but in the end by just going with the flow he does prosper in the end. Sinise lost that year in Best Supporting Actor category to Martin Landau for Ed Wood, but I think Sinise's performance has had a more lasting impact.

To those Americans who serve our country it certainly has. Gary Sinise has devoted a great deal of his life and earned treasure to bring entertainment to our overseas troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, wherever, becoming a successor to Bob Hope in that regard. He's gone further than that though, setting up foundations to help civilians in both countries and contributing to numerous charities dealing with war and its aftermath. Doing that in my humble opinion Gary Sinise has become one of the great Americans of our brand new millenia, a lot more than just an actor. He's forever now known as Lieutenant Dan.

In the end though the film belongs to Tom Hanks who joined with Spencer Tracy as the only two male actors to win back to back Oscars for Best Actor. Hanks fascinates us and guides us through this film and when we're done we've seen something very special.

If you don't believe me about how good Forrest Gump is, then watch it for a few minutes and see if you're not sucked in. Like Forrest's mama says, the film's like life which is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you'll get until you open it."""
30. Forrest Gump,10/10,One of the best films of the 90's,"Winston Groom's Forrest Gump was a novel that was complicated, but (Oscar winning) director Robert Zemeckis brings events together with visual effects that boggle even George Lucas.

And leading the film in this odyssey of American life is Tom Hanks playing Gump (he won his second Oscar for his portrayal) in a film that shows one man who goes through many events in history to find the one he loves. Well done, well acted, and well directed to pythagorean procision. A++

30. Forrest Gump,10/10,why such a low rating???,
30. Forrest Gump,10/10,The zen of Forrest Gump.,"This is a powerful yet charming movie; fun for its special effects and profound in how it keeps you thinking long after it's over. Like others, I've seen this movie more than once. One comment I've never heard is that Forrest's simplicity is almost zen-like. I should read the novel to get the author's intention (I remember some people preferring the book and complaining that no one at the Academy Awards gave him any credit.) But rather than an implication that you should do what you're supposed to do and believe in God and you'll win in the end, I see it as zen-like, i.e., living in the moment and not having expectations or particular cravings (other than his loving Jenny.) So he ends up just stumbling into all the major historical events of the time. Granted, he achieves this only because he doesn't have the brains to think otherwise and actually have expectations, but so many of our problems are because we do have higher intellect and desires, which ironically makes us unhappy because we know what we are missing. We love our cats and dogs for the same simplicity and always being in the moment. There's a line in the movie wondering if everything is predestined or happens randomly or it's a combination of both. It is something to mull over for a long time."
30. Forrest Gump,10/10,Life's Lessons in one Movie...,"When I first saw this movie I didn't appreciate it like I do now. I think it may have been because I was so young when I first saw it. Just recently I saw the movie again. What an amazing story and moving meaning. That movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it. That life isn't as bad as most people make it seem. That an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. The meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life. That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don't like it. That we all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that feels like there's no hope... I just love this movie. And anyone who hasn't seen it or who thinks that don't like it I seriously suggest seeing it or seeing it again. It truly is amazing...

30. Forrest Gump,10/10,"After 20 years, I still love Forrest Gump!","When I originally watched this with my mom 20 years ago, we both were pretty touched by the events of Forrest Gump's life and the way he handled things. So now, watching this in IMAX with my movie theatre-working friend, it's the same feelings all over again but now having some additional life experiences, one notices things one hadn't thought of before. Like how the first person who sits with Forrest on the park bench is so uninterested in his story she takes the wrong bus and admits it to him while the last one who sits with him doesn't take her scheduled one because she's so immersed in hearing about his life! Or how Jenny realizes how much she truly loves him despite the way she sometimes treated him. Robert Zemeckis truly made a very compelling picture. And Tom Hanks delivered a wonderful performance worthy of a second Oscar win. Nice humorous stuff involving Hanks mixed in real news footage of the various presidents. And great music soundtrack to mark the times they lived in. Oh, and I loved the supporting cast of Mykelti Williamson, Sally Field, Gary Sinise, and Robin Wright as Jenny. With all that said, I'll now just say that Forrest Gump is worth all the praise and adulation it has gotten over the years."
30. Forrest Gump,10/10,"""I just felt like running"".",
30. Forrest Gump,7/10,Neither as good or as bad...,"People seem of two minds about this film: it either moves them to tears or to nausea. But in reality, it is a well-made film with some strong performances but not more than that. The core of this movie that is as simple minded as the title character; the facile speciousness of the movie's reactionary attacks on matters I agreed with made me realize just how shallow the movie's entire argument is.

But beyond that, the movie is very well made; Hanks's performance could have been annoying in other hands but works well here. Sinise was excellent as well. Robin Wright's performance was adequate - I try not to blame her for the movie's implied argument that the social movements of the 60's and 70's were a working out of childhood neuroses - but never really stuck to me. The technical aspects of the film are outstanding, and the movie has a lot of laughs and tears despite its empty headed core.

If it helps anyone, this is my wife's favorite movie. But then, she fell asleep during Casablanca, so...."
31. The Silence of the Lambs,10/10,As good as its notorious reputation suggests.,"Young FBI Agent Clarice Starling is chasing a ruthless serial killer, she enlists the help of convict Doctor Hannibal Lecter, a notorious cannibal and master of manipulation.

If suspense thrillers are your thing, then this must rate as one of the greatest ever made. This film is genuinely unsettling throughout, you'll be wondering just who is playing who at times.

An absence of blood and gore, this relied on the story and acting, for my money it's infinitely superior to the films that followed. The psychological terror is the key to this films success.

Jodie Foster is excellent as Clarice, but Hopkins, what can you say, it's another of those performances that make you fully aware that he is one of the very best, he is outstanding in the role.

The dynamic and chemistry between Hopkins and Foster is off the scale, the tension, the unease, the uncomfortable forged bond.

I think this is where my love of Chianti comes from.

The Silence of the Lambs,10/10,"Dr.Lecter, I'd like to see you again...","The Silence of the Lambs runs two hours.Anthony Hopkins appears for little more than sixteen minutes, yet during those minutes he hasn't bored you for a second, not even after the tenth or eleventh viewing. Such is the power of his performance, it's absolutely impossible to forget him.His character, Dr.Hannibal""The Cannibal"" Lecter, is a brutal killer with revolting methods and habits, but he's also very intelligent, charismatic and with good taste(you can interpret that as you like).A clichè by now, but who cares? He still is one of the key elements in this wonderful thriller, which sees Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling asking for Lecter's help to catch another killer.The result is a dangerous yet fascinating relationship between the young, unexperienced FBI-agent and the convicted,but basically omnipotent, psychiatrist.He's a step ahead of everyone all the time, and makes sure everyone notices, with his witty, unforgettable one-liners.If there had to be only one reason to worship this movie, then it would have to be the chemistry between the two leading actors.Never before has a non-sexual man/woman connection been more thrilling.Never before has a film's ending been more unsettling and brilliant and left us asking for more.

Best watched with a nice Chianti...

P.S. dear film-buffs, have the lambs stopped screaming?"
31. The Silence of the Lambs,10/10,"Rare to experience a dark n twisted thriller aided by top notch performances, tight script n direction.","I first saw this in the early 90s on a vhs and i still remember how two very old ladies were petrified n blabbering about the movie to my dad and one thing which stayed with me after that conversation was the praising of Hopkins acting by the two grumbling old geezers.

I revisited it in the early 2k on a dvd which I own and was in awe by Hopkins mesmerizing performance.

Revisited it the third time today but this time with my kids as they are 18 now but my wife is still not agreeable.

Everything has been said about this first class thriller n there seems to be nothing left but i jus wanna contribute a lil by praising the performance of Hopkins.

In the entire movie, it is Hopkins' screen presence n footage which keeps u glued.

His character is charismatic but very dangerous that u don't wanna be rude with him.

Some scenes are far fetched but like i said it is the mesmerizing performance by Anthony Hopkins which is the highlight."
31. The Silence of the Lambs,10/10,A Story And A Character That You Can't Forget,"I'll never forget my first viewing of this movie at the theater and will always look back fondly on it for one reason: helping me quit smoking cigarettes.

I read the book first, was fascinated by it, and couldn't wait for the film to come out. That was the day I picked to quit smoking and I knew this movie would take my mind off that matter. I was expecting an intense movie and I got it. Little did I realize how well-received this film would be and how it propelled Anthony Hopkins to super-stardom.

Although entertaining, this is not always a fun movie to watch, especially with the scenes with Ted Levine who plays the killer, ""Buffalo Bill."" ""Bill"" and his kidnapped young woman are sick and profane people, respectively, and their scenes are very unpleasant. This movie is not for the squeamish with those and other scenes involving the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins). There also is some extreme crudeness in the jail/dungeon where Lecter and other inmates are held.

Jodie Foster is excellent as the FBI agent ""Clarice Starling"" and Scott Glenn is low-key and effective as ""Jack Crawford."" A major part of the film is psychological more than violent as Lecter constantly taunts ""Clarice,"" while she tries her best to manipulate him to help with a case. The by-play between the two is a game in itself.

Hopkins, however, is the actor people remember best from this movie. His portrayal of the refined-yet-cannibalistic serial killer-doctor is one viewers will never forget. I've enjoyed watching him in the sequels, too. The looks on his face, his fascinating vocabulary with intelligent sarcasm and frankness, never ceases to entertain.

""Silence Of The Lambs"" has turned into a modern-day ""classic."" If by some odd chance you have never seen this movie, be warned it is a dark, difficult story to watch at times....but it will get your mind off other things."
31. The Silence of the Lambs,10/10,"""The Godfather"" of all thrillers","I've seen way too many thrillers. You name it: ""Identity"", ""Seven"", ""The Usual Suspects"", etc., etc., etc. I remember my friend being so obsessed with ""Silence of the Lambs"", that it drove me crazy. And I hated the movie naturally and refused to see it. But everyone told me that I have to see this, so I let my guard down. And had an open mind, and I'm glad I did. My friend was right, this is a great movie. It is so well acted, I couldn't even describe. I loved ""Silence of the Lambs"" and would recommend it to anyone. It's creepy and exciting. Trust me, you'll love it.

31. The Silence of the Lambs,9/10,A thrilling must see,"I just saw, for the second or third time, this cinematographic masterpiece, during an « UGC culte » evening, in Paris. The list of the Big Five Academy Award winners is short. There are currently three of them, in nine decades: It Happened One Night (1934), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and ... The Silence of the Lambs (1991). This is not really surprising, this film being excellent, endowed with a script skillfully elaborated by Thomas Harris, with an irreproachable casting including Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster and Scott Glenn. In addition, the director Jonathan Demme delivers a work obviously enjoying an admirable preparatory work.

Without unduly spoiling the script, if you have not seen it yet, by the greatest fluke: a psychopath known as the Buffalo Bill sows terror in the Middle West by kidnapping and murdering young pulpy women, after partially or completely skinning them. Clarice Starling, a young FBI agent, is in charge of interviewing Hannibal Lecter, a well-known former psychiatrist who has also the characteristic of a truly intelligent psychopath focused on cannibalism. Hannibal Lecter is able to provide Clarice Starling with providential information about Buffalo Bill . But he agrees to help her only in exchange for information about the young woman's private life. Between them is established a link of fascination and repulsion.

As a synthesis: a thrilling must see. 9/10 of 10"
31. The Silence of the Lambs,10/10,A truly remarkable film,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits

Rookie FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned to get into the mind of notorious incarcerated serial killer Dr Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to get his evaluation on the elusive Buffalo Bill, a serial killer who's been abducting and killing young women. When a prominent senator's daughter is kidnapped, it becomes a race against time to find her before she is killed and all the while Lecter is playing mind-games with Starling as well as any help he can provide...

The first of Thomas Harris's Hannibal novels to be adapted for the screen, only to be followed some years later with some very lacklustre (but inevitable!) follow-ups, despite it's age this remains one of the most effective chillers of modern times. Despite the mainstream appeal of the film, the grainy lighting and laid-back budget give it an art-house feel that sets it apart from other such films that were as successful. The film manages some effectively disturbing scenes that make it a not altogether pleasant viewing experience.

Performances wise, in a very early role, a young Foster shows her promise for future roles, with a gripping portrayal of naivety and vulnerability here that is very compelling and convincing, even though there are some plausibility problems with someone as junior as her being assigned to do something like that. Hopkins too is brilliant as Lecter, playing a dangerous man behind bars who's ability to get inside your head and see the things you don't want him to see makes him no less dangerous, if not more so, than if he was on the outside. He's certainly received the most acclaim for his role over the years, but in my humble opinion, he's actually over-shadowed (though only slightly!) by Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill, a truly extraordinary psychopath with an unsettling sexuality disorder that is probably one of the nastiest things ever to be seen in such a mainstream film. As supporting FBI agent Crawford, Scott Glenn is impressive but sort of just faded into DTV land after this film.

It's easily one of the most popular films ever made, so it's likely a lot of you are familiar with it already, but with reviews on the so-inferior follow-up films Red Dragon and Hannibal, I thought it only right that I'd finally give this first film a mention. Truly remarkable. *****"
31. The Silence of the Lambs,10/10,A rare contender for the best film of all time,
31. The Silence of the Lambs,10/10,Truly enthralling film and not one to forget,"I have seen some great movies, old or new. The Silence of the Lambs is an amazing one, while not my personal favourite of the year of 1991 it was a well deserved Best Picture win in my opinion.

Jonathan Demme's direction is superb, the film is shot in a ceaselessly atmospheric manner and Demme never lets the suspense drop. The story from start to finish is enthralling, and the script is tense and thought-provoking.

The Silence of the Lambs is wonderfully acted as well. Jodie Foster is the one who holds the film together and her performance here is one of her most excellent, and I mustn't forget Ted Levine who is very chillingly effective as Buffolo Bill. Anthony Hopkins however steals the film, it is his perhaps most iconic character and he proves that although he is in only a portion of the film his performance lives long in the memory.

All in all, amazing. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
31. The Silence of the Lambs,8/10,Very Effective Thriller But Ultimately Overrated,"It's impossible to comment on SILENCE OF THE LAMBS as being a mere film . Its release was a watershed in popular culture and has influenced a myriad of imitations that are far too numerous to mention . Much of this success is down to director Jonathan Demme who has made the film so effective by coming up with the strikingly simple idea of filming everything in dim lighting which gives SILENCE a moody and brooding atmosphere that was absent from movies in the previous decade . Ironically enough this is as typical of 90s film making as MANHUNTER was of 80s movies . Howard Shore's score also helps the proceedings and Jodie Foster gives a sublime nuanced performance as vulnerable heroine Clarice Starling . Watch the scenes closely when Clarice is in the company of men , don't you get the feeling she has a phobia about the male of the species . Is she a victim of sexual abuse in her childhood ? A lesbian ? We never find out but Foster's performance is multi layered and it's a pity this aspect is never explored in HANNIBAL which sadly deletes this aspect to Clarice

Sadly SILENCE was released with a tidal wave of hype which the film doesn't live up to . Who can forget the stories that upon seeing this at the cinema certain audience members wanted armed escorts back to their cars ! I'm sorry but despite being a good thriller it's not that good and I fail to see how people were turned into quivering jellies unable to sleep with the lights off . I'm also afraid to say that much of the awards heaped upon the film aren't that well deserved either . Foster deserved the Oscar as did the film and possibly Demme too but did Ted Tally for his adapted screenplay ? All he seems to have done is to copy the best bits of Harris's novel wholesale into the screenplay without making an effort to improve anything . and i'll probably be accused of sacrilege but the more times I see this film the more times I ask myself how did Hopkins win the Oscar for Best Actor ? I don't even think Hopkins should have qualified for the Best Actor category since the role isn't on screen long enough and his performance is slightly hammy . Hannibal as played by Hopkins resembles something along the lines of a paedophile rather than a serial killer who has maimed , murdered and munched on adults . Despite having some reservations of Brian Cox as Hannibal in MANHUNTER you do believe his burly presence does have the physical strength to overpower his victims , not so Hopkins

I know it's very difficult , perhaps even impossible , but the best way to enjoy this movie is to erase from your mind the fact that it's one of only three movies to have picked up the Oscar in all five main categories , the fact that it made headlines about being the most terrifying film committed to celluloid , and the fact that it stands as the 28th best movie ever on this website . It is a very good thriller but one that is ultimately disappointing after hearing of the hype surrounding it"
31. The Silence of the Lambs,7/10,Some Careless Stitching,"Heaps of praise have been given to this multiple Oscar winner by Critics and Fans alike. It is sometimes disturbing, sometimes terrifying, and sometimes the Characters are engaging. Sometimes.

The Film is inconsistent in both style and substance. There are way too many close ups. After a few, the intended uneasiness is lost. Most of the sets are attractively unappealing and does give the sense of a forbidden place.

A striking performance from Hopkins but some of his cryptic inclusions using anagrams are uninteresting and at worst confusing and make no or little sense of irony. Jodie Foster seems forcing it, especially when asked to reveal some secret recalling the title of the Book and Movie. There are also some less than brilliantly enticing lectures from Hannibal about coveting and a scribbled note that is laughably sophomoric and we're off to catch the truly creepy Buffalo Bill.

Overall it adds up to be less than it seems. Some clever stuff but it is carelessly sewed together and with some tugging starts to unravel. Overrated, but influential, with some disturbing and dank scenes that make this a bumpy, irritating, and not quite completely satisfying ride to the Dark Side."

31. The Silence of the Lambs,10/10,The granddaddy of all serial killer flicks,"THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is, quite simply, a breathtaking movie. It's the granddaddy of all serial killer flicks, a film that even the almost-as-good SE7EN can only aspire to, a movie that gets into the mind and soul of a serial killer like few others. It inspired a huge sub-genre of similar movies that came out during the 1990s and 2000s, and it's up there with Hitchcock's PSYCHO as one of the most gripping looks at the subject matter of all time.

Where to begin? There's a pitch-perfect Jodie Foster, gradually leading us into the depths of the storyline as the naive FBI agent, and the oft-overlooked Ted Levine who excels as the supremely skin-crawling Buffalo Bill. Of course, the film is dominated by Anthony Hopkins, giving the best and most memorable performance of his career in just 16 minutes of screen time. Hopkins chills you to the bone in this, and Jonathan Demme's direction is a perfect match for his talents.

The storyline is engaging, ably mixing the criminal investigation strands with scenes involving the killers themselves. There are gory and monstrous set-pieces which make your flesh crawl while watching, yet it's all rather restrained and intellectual, a surprise given the subject matter. Most importantly, it's never less than gripping and completely frightening. A true masterpiece of a movie."

31. The Silence of the Lambs,10/10,One of the Greatest Thrillers of all Time.,"The Silence of the Lambs is a masterpiece you cannot miss, it's a masterwork of suspense that blends the elements of horror, crime and psychology into one tight and smooth story. It's only the third film in history to win Academy Awards in all the top five categories: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Adapted Screenplay and that imply something about its technical quality as a film. It features expertise level of craftsmanship in all departments of filmmaking, and takes a huge bonus from the exquisite performances put in by its stellar cast. After all these years The Silence of the Lambs remains in a league of its own and is a perfect exemplification of just how great a movie can become when all the right elements come together and work in perfect harmony to form a complete whole.

Based on the novel of the same name, Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling, a top student at the FBI's training academy. FBI agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) wants Clarice to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a genius psychiatrist who is also a violent psychopath, serving life behind bars for various acts of murder and cannibalism. Crawford believes that Lecter may have insight into a case of a serial killer called Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), that murders and skins his victims and that Starling as an attractive young woman, may be just the bait to make him help with the case.

The direction by Jonathan Demme is marvelous, as the film introduces its chilling sense of dread and has the audience on the edge of their seats, from the moment Howard Shore's ominous score hits the screen till the end of the film, especially during the climax with a lot of perfectly crafted suspenseful and nail-biting moments. The editing is perfect as the pace is methodical from start to finish, and each and every sequence is relevant to the story. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto is fantastic as it fully succeeds into creating a very dark and brooding atmosphere that captivates as well as terrorize the audience, while also exhibiting excellent camera work that makes heavy use of close-ups which increase the creepiness and tension along with displaying an optimal color palette and minimal lightning from start to finish, which further enhances the darker ambience the story was aiming for. Moreover, the production design team has done a magnificent work as every set piece is meticulously crafted, richly detailed and very well-lit. The script by Ted Tally, also packs a very well structured and tight plot, every character has a well-defined arc, all the themes are smartly addressed, the attention to detail is quite impressive, and the complete story and narrative are perfect.

The performances are incredible. Jodie Foster as Clarice is absolutely brilliant and gives an impeccable performance as a woman who is desperately trying to forget her painful past and yet at the same time tries to prove her worth in a male dominant world. Anthony Hopkins as the genius psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter is the perfect amalgamation of charisma, high intelligence and destructive violence, and gives a bone-chilling and memorable performance that will stand the passage of time as one of the absolute best. The small amount of screen time that Hopkins is given is a definitive testament to his acting capabilities, as with such an elegant and minimal performance, he solidifies himself as one of the most iconic villains of all time. Due to the charisma and electrifying chemistry between the two actors every scene they share becomes an instant classic.

In conclusion, the Silence of the Lambs is one of the greatest films ever made and a masterwork of brilliant direction, smart screenplay, splendid camerawork, tight editing, marvelous score and exquisite performances, that cemented the legacy of both Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster by engraving their iconic characters into the annals of cinema. The film absolutely deserves all the accolades and recognition it gets, for both its contributions to cinema and the immense impact it had on pop culture. Jonathan Demme's magnum opus is an outstanding achievement in genre filmmaking that has inspired and influenced countless thrillers since its release, and is not only the quintessential suspense and psychological horror film but also an ingenious observation of humanity's dark and violent nature and a masterpiece that every film lover must see."
32. Requiem for a Dream,9/10,"Great movie, I hated every minute of it","This movie is about how drugs can affect your life. Watching this movie really hurts. If you want to convince someone to stop doing drugs / live more healthy this is the movie to do it. Great acting (especially by Ellen Burstyn) and a realistic / convincing story but man is it painful to watch. This is the kind of movie you are happy to have watched at some point but you don't want to rewatch it because it is a real mood killer.

9/10 would recommend if you are looking for a heavy, dramatic movie.

32. Requiem for a Dream,10/10,A visual assault on the senses about the hellishness of addiction.,"Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn all star in this incredibly painful film about four people who are chemically dependent. When the film begins, the first three folks are all using heroin yet seem to be reasonably functional. Over the course of the film, their lives begin to disintegrate badly. At the same time, Burstyn plays an older woman who becomes addicted to amphetamines because of an irresponsible doctor who tosses out pills like candy...and she goes from a relatively normal lady to someone who seems like she's crossed over the line from sanity to oblivion.

""Requiem for a Dream"" is an exceptional movie and there's nothing else like it. However, it's a film that I am happy did not spur on other similar films, as it's also a visual assault on the senses and very difficult to watch...and I would hate to see film after film made like this Darren Aronofsky project. Using rapid intercutting (far, far more than normal) of scenes, fisheye lenses, exaggerated sound effects, shaking lenses, multipanes, television characters that come popping out of the screen and other strange gimmicks, he makes the viewer feel as if they, too, are stuck in the throes of addiction and, eventually, insanity! It's mesmerizing as well as unpleasant...and it's appropriately so considering the subject matter. In fact, I don't think a better film has ever been made about the hellishness of addiction...it sure captures it in all its vivid awfulness!

In addition to the incredibly clever use of all these films techniques, the movie has a lot going for it. The script, though very episodic, works well...and is made all the better thanks to some amazing performances, particularly by Burstyn. My only complaint about the film, and it's very minor, is that Jennifer Connelly is just way too pretty to be playing a woman who is that addicted. Sure, over time she falls apart...but she still looks model beautiful during most of the film. She would have been better looking skankier...or an uglier actress might have worked better!

So who would I recommend should see this film? Well, anyone who loves films and longs for something different should certainly see the film. Also, despite all the nudity, violence, vomiting and nastiness, I actually recommend parents consider showing it to their kids (especially if the teens have begun dabbling in drugs or thing it looks cool or fun). It will do far more to discourage them from using drugs than any pat message or sermonizing!! It shows drugs in all its sleazy awfulness....no holds barred. I challenge you to find a film THIS difficult to watch and effective when it comes to presenting the effects of drugs. I am not sure how the film received an R rating, as it seems more like something that should be NC-17. Horrible to watch...especially as the film progresses, so don't say you weren't warned!! By the end, I was in tears...

I should note that the Etc (electro-convulsive therapy) they show in the film is similar to the type done decades ago. They do NOT do shock treatment like this today and it is a relatively benign sort of treatment for folks who simply won't respond to other treatments for depression...thank goodness."
32. Requiem for a Dream,9/10,No need for a comfort zone.,"Requiem for a Dream (2000) - Directed by Darren Aronofsky

This film is a human-character-study. Darren Aronofsky's, crazy, rollercoaster, drug-induced Requiem for a Dream (2000). Aronofsky gives that 1980s feel to the viewer throughout the film. It has a fantastic calling to old-Hollywood-style film-making. The best component to the film is the acting.

Ellen Burstyn is Sara Goldfarb, a retired couch-potato, who is addicted to a bad self-help TV show that cons her into believing she can lose weight if she uses certain drugs, Pharmaceuticals that eventually destroy her mind and create a horrible addiction. Meanwhile, her dead-beat son, Harry (Jared Leto), comes up with the brilliantly dumb idea of creating a haven for himself, his friend, Tyrone (Marlan Wayans) and Harry's girlfriend, Marion (Jennifer Connelly), by getting into the street-drug-business. Unfortunately, he and his friends are all now junkies and things don't go so well as planned.

This film is not for the squeamish. It involves many horrible aspects of life, the terrible things humans are capable of doing to themselves and the consequences of such poor decisions. It does manage to pull at the heart-strings and makes you feel very sorry for these people. I won't say anymore, but there is a reason why Ellen Burstyn was nominated for the Best Actress Oscar that year. The directing, camera-work and editing is fantastic and quite fitting for the drug-incited delusions seen in the film. The film is rated R, but could have gone even further. Jennifer Connelly's performance is staggeringly good. She definitely leaves her comfort zone for this film. For myself, this film shocked, brought out many emotions and contained a life-lesson we should all pay attention to.

32. Requiem for a Dream,10/10,Film Making Excellence.,"I watch this movie like twice a year and it gets to me every time. By far my favourite movie ever. Instead of a regular review, here is everything this movie does perfectly.

Character Development: this could really be separated into three biopics. The way The film is spliced between three main characters that evolve an enormous deal over 100mins is a work of art within itself.

Plot structure and timing: This film is the pinnacle of an effective slow burn. At no point does the runtime seem to drag on, but it is slow enough to make the payoff incredibly valuable. Plot structure and timing are two of the most difficult things in film making, and they were executed perfectly in this one.

Sound and score: one of the most effective scores to date. The ups and downs of this film are only expressed further with an extremely effective and catchy score. At no points does it feel obnoxious or out of place, and you'll be thinking of it long after your viewing.

Cinematography: The beautiful mix of cinematography that are found throughout this film is perfect. Extreme close ups, split screen scenes and snapshots are all used to express the films ideas in a beautiful way. It does an excellent job to break up the story and to show you the multiple perspectives.

An incredible third act: So many great films fall down during the third act. Many-a-film has been ruined by a less than average third sequence, but this one ties up the whole story in a beautiful, non-abrupt way. I couldn't think of a better ending.

Performances: Each and every main performance in this film is done with grace and respect. I am always super surprised at Jared Leto's performance, as I've never seen him as an excellent actor. He steals the show here, with a genuine and emotional performance.

I really cannot think of anything I don't like or would change about this film. Incredibly engaging, beautiful story and told excellently.

Do yourself a favour and watch this masterpiece of filmmaking"

32. Requiem for a Dream,9/10,"""Requiem"" Is a Heavyweight","You will not so much as want to take a sip of wine after watching this mesmerizing film about the horrors of drug addiction. I was not a fan of director Darren Aronofsky's debut film ""Pi,"" but with this movie he proves to be a filmmaker of unlimited vision and style. Four characters in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn are all driven to despair due to their drug abuse, the saddest being Ellen Burstyn as a nice Jewish widow who unwittingly becomes addicted to prescription diet pills that help her lose weight but drag her into a world of hallucinations and paranoia. Burstyn is superb. It is so refreshing to see such a great veteran like her in such a challenging leading role, one in which she goes through a hell worse than that in ""The Exorcist.""

But this is a director's film if there ever was one. Aronofsky knows how to tell a story in a way that is dazzling in its use of sound, editing, and cinematography. The score by the Kronos Quartet and Clint Mansell is the most striking movie music I have heard in a very long time.

""Requiem for a Dream"" is not a movie for everyone. It is the essence of independent filmmaking, a daring, engrossing, artful film that stays with you long after you leave the theater. Hollywood bubblegum this ain't."
32. Requiem for a Dream,10/10,Harrowing,"A tremendous movie, one of those ones that couldn't be improved in any way, shape or form. The script explores the nature of drug addiction on four different characters, showing how it grips and degrades them in different ways.

Aronofsky, previously only known for indie hit PI, works wonders as director. He incorporates plenty of frenzied editing and stylish flourishes in a way that complements the story rather than distracts from it. Some of his work, like the chest-mounted cameras, is sublime and gets us into the heads of the characters like never before.

Of the cast, Ellen Burstyn towers head and shoulders above the rest in a performance that can only be described as haunting - perhaps one of the most haunting acting turns you'll ever see. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connolly share equally interesting story lines and are both strong, while what a surprise it is to discover that Marlon Wayans can actually act! The subject matter is grim indeed, with imagery that will stay with you long after watching. Pretty much the definitive look at drug addiction, this is a film that should be shown in every school."
32. Requiem for a Dream,8/10,I want to thank the director of this movie on behalf of the police,"No matter how happy you are, after you watch this movie, your feelings will be very different and even a little bit vomiting ... Suddenly I thought of a sentence, cherish life and stay away from drugs

32. Requiem for a Dream,10/10,"Brutal, honest, and a must see movie","This ranks up there as one of the three most powerful movies I have ever seen in my lifetime (Full Metal Jacket and Grave of The Fireflies being the other two). This movie shows the brutal honest side of addiction and over-indulgence. Not just drugs, although it heavily shows drug addiction. Also shows how one addiction can lead to another and how damaging it can be for you. I watched this alone, and felt so stunned afterwards, I had to call a friend just to calm my nerves. Seriously, this is a brutal (one more time) BRUTAL film. The acting is wonderful - Ellyn Burnstyn and Jenniffer Connely are just wonderful in this movie, and Marlon Wayons was such a shocker in a serious role. Everyone must watch it, for it's entertainment value, and more importantly, it's educational value. But it leaves chills down your spine for it's honesty and unforgiving lessons.

32. Requiem for a Dream,10/10,Absolutely Heartbreaking,
32. Requiem for a Dream,9/10,Message Received!,"No one can deny that the message in this movie was powerful. It reveals consequences to drug addiction that are unfamiliar to the general public. One consequence that I overlooked until now is that society would rather punish drug addicts than help them. It was interesting to watch those in positions of power as they abused addicts, took advantage of them, and showed utter indifference towards human life and dignity. I would have rated this movie with a 10/10, but one essential element was missing, backgrounds. Out of the four main characters, the movie only delved into the addiction history of one. It would have been nice to learn about the introduction and descent into drug dependence among the other main characters. They all seemed so beautiful and loving, but viewers would be more sympathetic if traumatic events were used to explain how life can take a turn for the worst.

32. Requiem for a Dream,9/10,Suicidal,"Well, I´ve seen ""Pi"" and was fascinated. Now, there´s ""Requiem for a dream"" and my expectations were very, very high. That can be the downfall for a movie, but in this case I wasn´t disappointed. Aronofsky proves not only that he can direct a ""bigger"" movie, he also shows how one can do so without selling out. To be more precise: ""RFAD"" is one of the most disturbing and depressing movies that came out of the US for a looooong time. From the opening scene to its final curtain it´s...well, a requiem for the characters, who are all perfectly portrayed by their actors. Ellen Burstyn is unbelievable. The power of her performance can only be compared to that of Björk in ""Dancer in the dark"". Aronofskys direction is even more experimental than in ""Pi"" and some of his ideas, like his combination of sound and picture are really innovative and give his movie a musical feel -without creating a long music video. On the downside, you could say that this movie offers no hope, no solution - but then, this would´ve been a lousy compromise.

32. Requiem for a Dream,10/10,A good trip gone bad...then worse,"Christ, this movie makes me never want to even get close to drugs.

This movie does a better job of scaring people away from drugs than any other PSA or DARE program ever could do.

""I'm going to be a star, Harry!""

5/5, now I'm going to need to call my mom before I break down.

32. Requiem for a Dream,10/10,Descending Into Junkie Hell.,
32. Requiem for a Dream,10/10,when dreams and nightmares collide...,"My God! ""Requiem for a Dream"" (2000), what a movie! It's always difficult to write reviews about perfect movies but I'm going to try. First, there are three adjectives which come to my mind to describe this movie and they're the ones which everyone thinks of: powerful, harrowing and heart-breaking and certain sequences remain engraved in the memories like for example, Jared Leto's wounded arm caused by drug.

To watch ""Requiem for a Dream"" is like being punched in the face. It's the kind of movie which can't leave indifferent. It is impossible to come out of this horrifying movie unharmed. It was made by a young director Darren Aronofsky whose previous movie ""Pi"" (1998) was very hailed. I must admit that I wasn't fully convinced by this indie movie but here, without a doubt, the director entirely hypnotized me and I thank him for that.

The movie was made from a novel written by Hubert Selby Jr. It isn't the first time that a work from this novelist is adapted for the screen. Indeed, in 1989, Uli Edel had shot ""Last Exit to Brooklyn"" which developed a nightmarish and apocalyptic vision of a mankind who lived in hell. Here, the movie focuses on 4 main characters. There's Harry Goldfarb. He, his girlfriend Marion Silver and his best mate Tyrone C Love plan to become high-rolling smack dealers. In the meantime, his mother Sarah Goldfarb has got her head in the clouds. She received a call and she learned that she's going to appear on television. At the beginning of the film, the 4 characters' hopes amazingly answers the shiny weather of the summer. But as we usually say: best things have an end. Summer will go away to leave place to fall and winter. Just like the dreams will slowly but surely shatter and the 4 main protagonists will embark on an endless suffering. A vertiginous descent into hell like we have never seen one and which will reach its climax in winter in the last half-hour of the movie. From this moment, the film presents a flood of incredible pictures; they are so painful so much that they make the view unbearable. However, you watch it flabbergasted with both repulsion and fascination.

Darren Aronofsky invites us to a climbing in the morbid. ""Requiem for a Dream"" strikes by its visual and sonorous frenzy. Through, accelerated frenetic sequences, hysterical split-screens, parallel images, the director doesn't pull his punches to describe this diving in absolute horror for the 4 characters. However, in his crazy making, there's none form of unwarranted nature. The features previously quoted may be disturbing but necessary to answer several things which aren't pleasant to hear like for example, to denounce the omnipresence of the consumer society. These abuses express themselves, here, by the crushing presence of objects, perfectly representative of this society like the television or the refrigerator. The another goals of the film: to make us share the physical and moral sufferings of a drug addict, notably through the deterioration of their visual and sonorous perceptions. But also to show us in a straight-forward and rough way, the dependence of a drug addict on his drug. Aronofsky's message is simple to understand. There's not only the drug like cocaine or amphetamines that make dependent but also simple objects apparently harmless which can become dangerous like the television or the refrigerator. They can destroy our faculties of reasoning and judgment. In a way ""Requiem for a Dream"" illustrates very well Brad Pitt's key cue in ""Fight Club"" (1999): ""things you own end up owning you..."". On the other hand, if we put the stress on drug, the least we can say is that the moments of shooting, the withdrawal times are showed with a realism and bluntness rarely reached. True, ""Trainspotting"" (1996) had already presented similar scenes but Darren Aronofsky isn't afraid to go further in daring.

It would be unfair to neglect the terrific cast. Beginning with Ellen Burstyn who in all respects gives a dazzling performance. She renders very well the degeneration of her character. In the beginning, she is a normal old lady but in the end, she looks like a senseless living dead. Why didn't she get her Oscar in 2001 instead of Julia Roberts in ""Erin Brockovich"" (2000)? Then, concerning Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly well their sensitiveness and fragility are impressive. But the biggest surprise is Marlon Wayans. Who could have thought that he could be at ease in a comic role (Scary Movie) as well as in a dramatic role? These 4 actors make particularly harrowing the very last sequences of the film which show them forever in the depths of despair or madness where pain, humiliation and misery suffer into them. And then, during the final credits, we can hear the sea with a little of relief as if we had just made a nightmare.

But what is extraordinary in Aronofsky's work is that he manages to find a little place for humor which acts in an efficient way. In conclusion, this young film-maker has shot a film with a real emotional power. I must confess that I almost shed a tear several times. ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a movie I highly recommend but beware! It's not a movie for everyone and for the spectators who didn't watch it, I advise you not to see it if you are in a sad mood. It demands a strong stomach and I think the people who say they weren't afraid during the projection are liars. Don't forget your handkerchief."
32. Requiem for a Dream,8/10,Disturbing unique vision,"Four lives are disintegrating. Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) is a drug fiend who keeps pawning off his mother (Ellen Burstyn)'s TV. He and his druggie friend Tyrone C. Love (Marlon Wayans) wants to start selling drugs on their own. She is obsessed with TV infomercial personality Tappy Tibbons (Christopher McDonald). She gets a call about her winning a TV contest and she's so excited that she goes on a crash diet. Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly) is Harry's girlfriend and she's pulled into his scheme.

It's director Darren Aronofsky's second full length feature, and it shows that he has an unique vision. These are compelling characters in unforgettable stories. Ellen Burstyn is completely immersed into her role. Their slow descent is hard to take and hard to take my eyes off of. The use of quick cuts, fast forwards, and close ups all accentuate the disturbing nature of drugs. The use of SnorriCam which attached to the actors' bodies is probably the most memorable. It's all very disturbing.

32. Requiem for a Dream,10/10,A unique look at addiction by Aronofsky/Selby; it's the best DARE movie never made (or would be made),"Mr. Aronofsky's Requiem for a dream definitely is unique- no other film I have seen on heroin and/or speed addiction has been filmed or acted like this. And it helps that I saw it again, because on a first viewing I looked more for the performances, and liked it, but didn't really regard the actual cinematic technique for it with as much un-equaled regard as many others have (at the time I considered it more of an MTV-styled take on a very powerful topic). But now watching it years later (2006 I mean, despite what the date of this comment says) I watch it, having gone through lots of other film-viewing experience, and I like it a lot more. In a way what's really mesmerizing and heartbreaking about the picture is that the contrivances are not based in the actual script or story- not that there isn't one or two that might be hard to not have in there- but rather a sort of fashioning of continuous cinematic contrivance.

In other words, Aronofsky pushes the bounds of everything that can be done with the camera and editing in terms of subjective-viewpoints, ideas through montage, and the power of abstractions in the realm of the main theme of the film- unattainable escapism. One might be tempted to compare to Eisenstein with the montage, but unlike him Arnonofsky isn't putting forward a political message, but a societal one. While the cinematography by Matthew Libatique and the editing by Jay Rambinowitz give the viewer the whole subjective, jarring view of what it feels like in the first person to do these dangerous drugs, some of the time, all this being says, it almost goes by too quickly (if you blink you'll miss the characters actually intaking the drugs, which are done in half second cuts). Not that that's a bad thing, and in fact the techniques used here, which include fast-motion, camera-strapped-on-the-front-of-a-person shots, odd high-angle placements, and wild array of things done that I still wonder how one could think them up, are quite ingenious. Only one scene on a repeat viewing- when Sarah Goldfarb (Burtyn) is going totally off the deep-end in her apartment with the TV show spiraling around her- doesn't totally work for me.

Also, it will be difficult for some people to view the characters in their dissension to demise. Bustyn, (who, if you still believe the Oscars to really be a mark of merit for true achievements, proves this to be false via her loss to the much less warranted Julia Robert) plays an old, lonely woman who dreams of getting on a game-show that she doesn't realize might not be real and decides her favorite red dress is all that matters for the show to the show. It's too small, so she goes to the doctor to get pills (uppers) and they do indeed work, but then she starts taking too, too many and ends up hallucinating that her refrigerator is moving (the first film to use a refrigerator puppeteer by the way) and then things start to spiral. This also goes for her entranged son Harry (Jared Leto) who is slipping into a descent into smack with his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) who sleeps with other men and then some in order to get stuff when Harry can, and his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans in his best performance to date) who is also descending, but might seem to have it not as bad as the others by the time the film ends.

But like I said, it is hard to view these characters falling deeper and deeper into insanity and desperation and all since it is also difficult to sympathize with these people. Yet, by the end of the film I almost felt like I was going to burst into tears not because I felt sad for the characters but more because of how powerful there journey led then to their destination. Like it or not though, this film begs for multiple viewings- and some extra years of looking at other films, which was the case with me. There is almost no room for true catharsis at the end, and nothing will ever be the same for anyone, especially as they're alive and lacking redemption (though if I had to place who's story is most compelling, and performance-wise as well, it would be Burstyn's)."
33. The Dark Knight Rises,10/10,"As of 2023, still the standout Batman movie.","There's a storm coming .....

Years after being villified, Batman is encouraged once again to come Gotham's aid, as it's in the grip of a group of mercenaries run by the villainous Bane.

First of all, you don't have to be a superhero fan to enjoy this great movie, it truly does have the most broad appeal, there's something here for everyone to enjoy. If you liked the two preceding films, I figure you'll love this one, I'm a fan of all three, this is my personal favourite.

It's a long movie, but it flies by at a canter, no single frame is wasted, it moves by at a terrific pace, it has incredible action sequences, but the story is terrific.

It's really interesting to see Batman coming in from a position where he's decided and feared, he's no longer accepted as Gotham's hero and saviour.

Christian Bale is the perfect Batman, and he is matched every step of the way by Tom Hardy. Hardy is off the charts as Bane, the last time we saw the character was back in The Batman and Robin film, perhaps best forgotten, here though he's an iconic villain.

I can't speak highly enough of Bale and Hardy, but this is also, I think the best of Anne Hathaway, she is excellent here.

A decade on, and this film is still fabulous.

10/10."
33. The Dark Knight Rises,9/10,A wonderful conclusion to a wonderful trilogy.,"After eight years in seclusion, Batman resurfaces to face Bane, a mastermind bent on destroying Gotham and has ties to Bruce Wayne's past. Christopher Nolan's conclusion to his Dark Knight trilogy should be treated as a wrap up rather than a third installment. Despite many new characters being introduced, even their conflicts and motives are derived from events that occurred in the previous two films. Such an approach could be seen as a weakness, since the conflict could just end up being sort of a rematch rather than moving the story forward; however, Nolan's approach works terrificly. Over an hour is shot in stunning IMAX, but the film is more touching than it is intense and that's its best quality. Hardy steps in as the genius mercenary Bane, who is slightly bigger, slightly stronger and slightly smarter than Batman, thus making him a challenge best suited for the grand finale. The Joker works best as Batman's arch-nemesis since they are polar opposites, with The Joker standing for everything Batman stands against. Two-Face works best as Batman's most tragic enemy because Harvey Dent is very much like Bruce Wayne the only difference is: Dent copes with his tragedy through revenge rather than seeking justice as Wayne did. Bane works best as Batman's most challenging villain because of his physical and mental superiority—forget the Bane you saw in ""BATMAN & ROBIN"". Nolan carefully chose all his villains in the series wisely and executed them perfectly. Hardy had big shoes to fill following Ledger's posthumous Oscar winning performance; while Bane is no Joker, Hardy does a satisfying job and should not be compared to Ledger's performance as they are completely different roles. It is Michael Caine, however, that delivers the most memorable and touching performance of the entire film. A wonderful conclusion to a wonderful trilogy.

33. The Dark Knight Rises,10/10,Best comic movie trilogy ever,
33. The Dark Knight Rises,10/10,My personal favourite of the trilogy,"I think as a film stand point, the dark knight is a better movie that is better acted and tense the whole way through. The dark knight rises to me is a more fun and action filled movie that you can sit back a bit more. The acting is still amazing and combined with the atmosphere/visuals of the movie creates a the sense of realism that the movie has. That realism is where the intensity stems from throughout the movie, the audience believing that something like this could actually happen makes it that much scarier. Bane is also an excellent villain, in the dark knight the joker challenges Batman mentally but Bane physically challenges him which is a completely new challenge for Batman. The plot is incredible, it it starts fast and instantly brings you into the action. It then takes a step back to develop the characters further and build up the challenge Batman has to face. Once one of the many challenges was overcome by Batman in launches the viewer straight back into action for one epic final battle that lasts almost an hour......and it is GLORIOUS! Not one second was I bored, it is truly incredible how each movie in the trilogy is this good, it shouldn't be possible. I've not even mentioned the incredible soundtrack to compliment the astounding yet grounded action. I can't compliment this movie enough. If you haven't someone seen this trilogy yet....watch it, you won't be disappointed."
33. The Dark Knight Rises,9/10,Epic,"The Dark Knight Rises was a perfect sequel to a masterpiece. Christopher Nolan took a different direction and focused more on Bruce Wayne/Batman. This movie is filled with lots of emotions. It has such great characters and of course the dialogs is so good. The performances are incredible. It was my most anticipated movie of the century. The more I watch it, The more epic it gets. Personally, I think The Dark Knight Trilogy is the greatest Trilogy of all time and this movie gives the greatest ending of all time in the movie history. I remember seeing it thrice and the more I watched It the more respect it earns. Thank you Christopher Nolan, You Sir Are A Master.

33. The Dark Knight Rises,9/10,What a way to end the trilogy!,"Possibly my personal favourite of the Nolan Batman films, and I do like Batman Begins and The Dark Knight very much. Is it perfect? For me, not quite, there are so many plot strand in a long running time that the film occasionally(and there is a big emphasis on that) sags in momentum and some of the strands in the ending could have done with more development. It is a brilliant film all the same, one of the highlights so far of the year. As to expect from Christopher Nolan, it is a visually audacious film, with gorgeous cinematography, a beautifully realised Gotham City and great special effects. Hans Zimmer's score is not one of his very best for me, but there is still an epic and haunting quality that is just perfect for this film. The dialogue provokes thought and makes an emotional impact, and a vast majority of the time The Dark Knight Rises is ambitious and gripping. I don't consider Christopher Nolan one of my favourites, this said he is a hugely impressive director who shows great ambition and a willingness to make his subject matters interesting. He does a really wonderful job here, as the set/action pieces including the plane hijack and Bane's assault on Gotham are enough to make the jaw drop. The performances are just terrific from all involved, Matthew Modine fares weakest but he is far from bad. Christian Bale is still a charismatic presence, Matthew Caine appropriately loyal and Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman subtly understated. Joseph Gordon Levitt captures his character's idealism wonderfully. Tom Hardy is in beefed-up terrifying mode as Bane, a worthy successor to Heath Ledger's iconic Joker. Anne Hathaway was a curious casting choice, but as Catwoman she is spot on, here is a Catwoman who actually does much more than acting sexy(which she still is), she is very ruthless and no-nonsense here. All in all, a hugely impressive film, the best of Nolan's Batman trilogy- though I'm prepared for any flaming I'll get for this opinion- and one of the highlights so far of 2012. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
33. The Dark Knight Rises,10/10,No one wraps up a trilogy like Nolan.,
33. The Dark Knight Rises,10/10,It was okay...,"The best thing about this movie is how satisfying it is. It doesn't leave you frustrated or confused. You can't really complain that it didn't explore certain ideas or follow through. By deciding to have an official ending to this trilogy's story, the themes surrounding Batman are very fresh. We don't know where he'll end up. It's not the same old thing about whether he can continue to be Batman or not, which was already getting repetitive in Spider-man 2. The conclusions are not as important as the feelings they invoke as they come about. Nolan is especially good at capturing the complete tension of actually not knowing what will happen and deeply questioning what you *want* to happen and why.

This movie is bigger than the previous two, far more ambitious. There are no obvious annoying weaknesses that usually come with films in general, especially blockbuster action movies. All of Nolan's movies have deep psychological themes and this takes those in another new direction. I thought Inception was hugely original and insightful about the way people think. That level of abstraction and depth is present in this film. Bane bursts into it, his reputation is quickly established. Nolan uses people's expectations and anticipation to the fullest. We are left to wonder about what has happened in the 8 years since the events of The Dark Knight. Why have the characters become the way they are now?

In the latter half, it does seem like the movie is trying to pull off so many different plot points and connections, but they all work. The cast is very large and impressive. You don't see ""good acting"". You see fascinating characters. They're just playing their part in the grand story that's being crafted. There are many unfamiliar faces but they all have a strange, unique look to them. We often see a person's flaws and previous decisions coming back to haunt them. They find out the hard way what mistakes they have made. Where their limits are. Where they lose control.

The score is almost tribal, very raw and energetic. You don't get much chance to pay attention to it but many parts of the movie are pounding with excitement. There are countless quotable lines and disturbing slices of dialogue. They cut deep. The Joker was a great character and this is a very different movie but the themes are just as dark, only perhaps indirectly. Underneath, it's very sinister. Writing and efficiency appear to be among Nolan's greatest strengths. The story has many layers that interweave and apparently they came in under budget.

Perhaps the most important thing about Catwoman is that she's completely believable. When she beats up men, you don't roll your eyes. She's feminine and powerful in her own way. She fits into the world and we completely understand her motivations. She doesn't have a huge role but a very important one.

I didn't find myself moved but maybe I'm too cynical. I was more affected psychologically. Curious about humanity and all the different sides of it you see in this movie. It goes to many extremes. I felt humbled by my complete lack of life experience. What do I know about anything? How could I possibly understand half of the characters? I haven't been through anything or achieved anything compared to most of them. Michael Caine gets a bigger role this time. He was always critical but this time he's very much the emotional core.

I thought Christian Bale was overlooked in The Dark Knight especially. The movies hinge on him. Bruce Wayne's just a man but also incredibly inspirational. Bale's famous for completely committing to his roles and it pays off. Tom Hardy is impressive as Bane but I suppose that's no surprise. The rest of the leads are similarly awesome. There are many references to the earlier films. Very few questions are left unanswered. It's always nice when film-makers really think it through and make an actual decision and get all the details right.

So anyway, I'll miss Batman (since the trilogy has ended) but couldn't have hoped for a better, more epic and sincere finale to his story."
33. The Dark Knight Rises,10/10,"Best Film of 2012, so far!","I had the honor of watching TDKR during a screening and was completely blown away! Christopher Nolan's third film in his Batman trilogy doesn't disappoint. The movie is incredibly well made, its huge production is quite breathtaking to view. This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The movie's score high-lites many of its incredible scenes, and at times, it takes your breath away.

The film featured excellent performances, by all the cast. Christian Bale, as always is great as Batman. Anne Hathaway was completely engrossing, she became ""Catwoman"", just like Michele Pfeiffer did, although their interpretations were very different, both were equally effective. Tom Hardy was the main villain ""Bane"" completely shattered my expectations. One of the best superhero movie villains, I've ever seen. The terror caused by him, is completely believable and quite menacing. Marlion Cotilliard, Michael Cane, Gary Oldman, and others all did well in their respective roles. Now I know most will miss Heath Ledger as the Joker.(I know I do) I hope people don't compare Tom Hardy's performance to Heath Ledger's, its completely unfair and the two characters are very different. Just read the comics.

The colossal size of the film is a spectacle to behold, but surprisingly you don't get lost with all the explosions and extravagant action scenes, like in other films,(AKA Transformers, or POTC.) If one were to gripe, and I suppose there will never be a film made that one cannot find a point at which to grip, it is painfully long running time here. I found myself more worried about the pain in my posterior than the emotional final minutes after almost 3 hours that I had spent in a cramped seat, but that's just how I am. However the ending is just fantastic, so emotional and bring the trilogy to a very satisfying end.

Sorry if I'm being all fan-boyish and kissing this movie's behind, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favorites but generally this seems to be the movie event of this year. As a film though, this is amazing. A true lasting legacy in superhero story telling and summer-blockbusters."
33. The Dark Knight Rises,10/10,A Nutshell Review: The Dark Knight Rises,"There are plenty of elements that made this film work, so I suppose we can tick them off one by one. For starters, the continuation on the focus of Bruce Wayne's story, which has made it all tick. This version of Bruce Wayne and Alfred become the familiar characters we're accustomed with since 2005, and the film invests heavily on the emotional bonding between the two, which deals back to the theme about fear that rears its ugly head again, and how a father figure cannot stand idly by to watch the one he brought up recklessly charge into battle after a long hiatus, and hoping for a life of normalcy with the mantle of the bat given up. Michael Caine may have a shorter screen time than before, but no less powerful.

When Sam Raimi had to put the popular and powerful Venom into Spider-man 3 pretty much against his wishes, we all knew how that turned out to be, effectively killing off the franchise until the decision to reboot it. There may be some similar fears with the introduction of a fairly contemporary villain in Bane, but the story gave him more purpose and meaning, and Tom Hardy was excellent par none in this role as the compete villain - with plenty of brawn, merciless, masterful, and with a plan any terrorist would be proud of. If the Scarecrow meant to induce fear, and the Joker to create chaos, Bane is carnage incarnate. Tom Hardy, even being the requisite mask, is fearful, and while the designs of his plan may dwarf the Joker's in complexity, it sure rivaled his in terms of delivery, and execution. Anyone in his path gets shoved aside with deadly consequences, and anyone alive is only because there is of further use. No hesitation, and no compromise.

And Nolan continues with the introduction of a lot more villains big and small, behind a mask or otherwise, in his Bat films than anyone would credit him for, especially when having those whose lines are blurred, or corrupt to the core and hiding behind social status and fortune. This in turn provides for another arc that boils underneath the main narrative, where the rich and powerful continue to enjoy their successes at the expense of the have-nots, and the Occupy Movement in a way being a very real parallel to the proceedings on screen. While the mobsters were clearly at the top of the food chain in the earlier Nolan films, this one shifted focus to politicians and the elite community, with their fair share of scandals and corporate greed.

While Bane was to the point, Selina Kyle played by Anne Hathaway, is both sensual and a force to be reckoned with herself, being like how she's best portrayed, on the fence. There's a bit of Frank Miller's Year One in this one given the presence of Juno Temple's Holly, and the back to basics as a jewel thief, compared to the mousy secretary in Tim Burton's Batman Returns with Michelle Pfeiffer defining the role, and the garbage that was Halle Berry's. Anne Hathaway nailed this one with what would be a truly memorable outing, and as if a homage of sorts to Burton's second Batman film, that the repartee between Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle at a party became one of the highlights here, as does her thievery and combat ability. She may lack her whip, but more than makes up for it with her steel stiletto heels, and the very sensual and sleekly designed feline moves that you'd wonder how they got delivered while wrapped under that skin tight suit.

And not only is the technology put on screen fictionally impressive, the technical aspects behind the scenes also worked wonders, chalking up serious mileage in having more than an hour's worth of footage shot on the IMAX format. Wally Pfister's cinematography continues to impress with that staying consistent to the gritty look and feel developed for all the Bat films to date, before his departure into a film director's role for his next project. Hans Zimmer also probably developed the best score for Nolan's Bat films, and I dare say without which this film would be less stellar, with the score playing a huge role in adding plenty of character and emotion to the film, lifting it up with excitement during the many set action pieces, with recognizable themes assigned to major players, heightening dangers, and providing a boost to the many feelings in this one heck of an action-adventure.

With how things developed at the end, and what I felt was initial horror of sorts with Batman out in broad daylight, secret identity being porous and all, this film ended in what would be the best way possible - with possibilities, and a twinkle of an eye, Inception style with a did it, or did it not. Twists, turns, surprises and sleight of hand, making it a clear favourite as one of the best this year. Do yourself a favour and watch it in the IMAX format, just as it was intended.

Because you have just got to believe in Christopher Nolan, and the kind of films he has so far delivered. Take a bow, bat-crew, for a trilogy that has now set the bar for any comic book film, and especially any other follow Batman movie, reboot or otherwise, to live up to."
33. The Dark Knight Rises,10/10,"The Best ""Batman"" Movie Ever!!!",
33. The Dark Knight Rises,10/10,Stunning Conclusion to an Epic Trilogy,"Not being a huge fan of superhero movies, I didn't have much expectations for Batman Begins. However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, ""The Dark Knight"", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""The Dark Knight Rises""? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch.

The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Christian Bale, of course still makes is a great Batman. Michael Cain is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination. Tom Hardy as Bane is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. The Dark Knight Rises is is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.

At a running time of almost 3 hours, the film never becomes dull, which is pretty impressive. The movie's action sequences are spectacularly well created and very intense. The dialogue between the character's are intelligent and highly believable. The movie's soundtrack is terrific and really exemplify's many of the movie's scenes. Extremely well editing and sound use really develop many of the movie's action scenes, so it's not just explosions and visuals like in many other movies. Nolan creates a grand, dirty, engrossing world, and his action sequences just hum.

In conclusion, this film is a gorgeous reminder that great writing and direction can enhance any movie-going experience, even superhero movies, which are usually thought of as mindless entertainment. I am wholly satisfied with Christopher Nolan's vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of its very famous literary source. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. 10/10"""

33. The Dark Knight Rises,9/10,"Sometimes predictable, but often astonishing","Christopher Nolan's stunning conclusion to his Batman trilogy is a welcome return to form after the slightly overrated THE DARK KNIGHT, which was so obsessed with being all dark and brooding that it forgot to tell much of a story. Despite the presence of a much-hyped (and lamented) Heath Ledger in the cast, I found that film to be less entertaining than BATMAN BEGINS although it still remains an engaging and watchable film. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES (horrible title, by the way), though, blows it out of the water, offering a piece of sheer spectacle that's as involving and as tightly-plotted as you could wish for.

It's eight years since the last film, and Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne is nowadays retired and definitely feeling his age. Before long, though, a hulking brute of a bad guy (Tom Hardy, whose sheer physicality in the role will surprise nobody who's seen Bronson) decides to do some very unpleasant things in the city, so it's time to dust off the bat suit and get back into the action. Good news for the viewer.

As usual, Nolan surpasses the conventions of his genre, making this a superhero film that looks nothing like a superhero film, instead more like a modern-day epic of dramatic cinema. Yes, at the end of the day it's still about suited guys beating the hell out of each other, and Nolan once again relies on old conventions/clichés (such as the 'ticking bomb' trope, which he's repeated in his last three films now) to see him through, but everyone runs so well and so smoothly that you end up not minding.

The cast is thorough and involved as ever, Bale as usual going the extra mile to portray the tortured hero and Caine lending emotional support as Alfred. Hardy's villain is a sheer powerhouse who dominates every scene he's in, and Nolan brings back a couple of his favourites from INCEPTION (Marion Cotillard and Joseph Gordon-Levitt) for good measure. There's not quite as much action as you might expect from a film of this type, but the storyline is so involved that you don't care. Throw plenty of stunning special effects into the mix and you have a real crowd-pleaser of a film with real brain as well as brawn."
33. The Dark Knight Rises,3/10,"Boys, Playing It Cool -- Bruce","One star for Joseph Gordon-Levitt's fresh and believable take on the rookie cop with street smarts, ideals and courage.

One star for Anne Hathaway's purr-fect performance as the Catwoman.

One star for an aging Michael Caine, in memory of the man who was a king.

Beyond that, it's all a murky sea of meaningless explosions, sodden speeches, missed opportunities, and plot holes you could drive the Batmobile through.

Some lowlights include . . .

A super villain who mumbles so much he might just as well have a sock in his mouth. And speaking of laundry, why can't Bane afford an undershirt?

A doctor who explains in clinical detail, with X-rays, exactly why Bruce Wayne can't fight anymore. Just so his fight scenes will feel even more fake than they already did.

A pointless half hour in a phony-looking prison in some make believe foreign country where guys walk around all day clapping and chanting. Cool Hand Luke, this ain't. I really didn't care if Bruce Wayne climbed out of that stupid hole with a rope -- but then, the guards didn't seem to care much either. (""Climbin' out of here, boss!"" ""Yeah, Bruce, climb on out of there."") All I wanted was for Bruce to ""prove"" himself by eating fifty eggs, like in the Paul Newman classic. And at the end he could send the boys a postcard of him back in Gotham City, wearing a custom-made suit, with his arms around Miranda and Selena Kyle. And the card could just say, ""Boys, playing it cool -- Bruce.""

A staggering total of 3000 cops trapped in a sewer for three months -- yet they all emerge in clean uniforms, in good health, ready to beat Bane's minions in a good old-fashioned street brawl. And even that was more exciting than watching Bane and Batman go one-on-one.

This movie could have been twice as good and half as long, with one tenth of the money spent. All it takes is imagination, courage, and respect for the audience."
33. The Dark Knight Rises,10/10,A satisfying conclusion to a fantastic trilogy... so that's what that feels like,"It's been eight years since the events of the immediate predecessor to this(a film that this matches in most ways, tops in several, and the only thing it lacks that that has, is Heath Ledger's Joker, and, well, that's part force majeure), and we see the outcome of that. Legislation has made organized crime a thing of the past in the city, and with no need for the caped crusader, Bruce(once again impeccably acted by Bale... and yes, the voice has thankfully been toned down) has a gap in his life that he doesn't know how to fill(straining the relationship between him and Alfred, played by the usually charming and compelling Caine). When a mysterious masked man, known as Bane, a dominating physical presence with a brain(played largely by Hardy's eyes and brows... taking a ton of his tools as an actor away, and still he does incredible), with unclear motives makes his presence known, he realizes he will have to become Batman again. But is he enough to take out this new threat? This finishes the series, providing closure to the characters and story. Catwoman is done right here, and just about perfect. She's finally a femme fatale... hot and manipulative. They do with her what we hoped they'd do with Black Widow. And this does justice to the relationship between her and Wayne. The performances are great all around. Most return from the other two(and Freeman gets a lot more to do), with a few new faces, such as Gordon-Levitt as idealistic cop John. This does a lot to surprise us, and like TDk, it does it right, with hardly any of them being unnecessary, and none of them insulting. The bleakness is back and amplified - this puts its titular hero and its audience through a serious amount of pain and conflict, with a genuine feeling that it might not work out. And as a result of this, and other brave decisions made(you can barely believe these are mainstream movies!), it becomes really powerful, really draws us in. The action is the biggest and best of these(the jet he uses is awesome! And the Pod gets some more really cool use, in the edge-of-your-seat chases, and we get fast martial arts(and covered well!), and the stakes and tension are the highest(and frankly, if they were raised any higher, it would be excessive... this is already as draining as the last one). There is a lot of disturbing content, some violence and a little moderate to strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone interested in these(and make sure you've watched the other two first, this really adds to them). 10/10"
33. The Dark Knight Rises,1/10,An Abject Failure...,"A horrible, bloated, clumsy and often surprisingly amateurish mess that constantly reaches for profoundly unearned emotions and falsely pumped-up thrills.

Ann Hathaway's Catwoman is, by miles, the best thing in this overcrowded, misguided concoction (of course she's never called Catwoman, because ultimately Nolan is embarrassed to be doing a super hero movie, as virtually every creative decision he makes here proves). But like anything else that might even be a little bit interesting in this movie, her character and storyline are steamrolled with the rest of the ingredients into a flat, boring cacophony.

The music is relentlessly pounding, probably in the hopes that you wont notice how rickety and poorly crafted the story is.

Christian Bale virtually phones in his performance. He plays Batman as a mouth-breather (he actually never closes his mouth when in the cowl, making Batman look like some poor kid at summer camp with severe allergies) and he's incapable of bringing the slightest touch of character to Bruce Wayne. Where is Batman the master martial artist? The World's Greatest Detective? The unstoppable force of nature? Not here. Not in this movie.

And the amazing Tom Hardy? Completely wasted and mostly unintelligible.

The script is a train wreck. There are more plot holes and leaps of logic in this film than in the Avengers, and that movie had a Norse God fighting alongside a monster of science against giant interdimensional worms. The Avengers, by the way, was twice as fun, which was expected, but shockingly, only half as stupid as this movie.

Here, let me give you a rundown of terrible, terrible logic loops, sustained stupidity, and just flat out disregard the for audience's intelligence. SPOILERS!

1. A massive terrorist raid on the stock exchange to make a single trade that leaves Bruce Wayne Broke. Okay... what the f.u.c.k.? A. Hacking a computer system does not require proximal space violence. It's called hacking. B. You're telling me they didn't shut down the stock exchange in a crises situation? C. No one questioned a massive trade that rendered one of the wealthiest men in the world broke, when that trade was performed in the middle of a destructive high-speed chase that would have been news across the entire country, let alone the entire world?

2. Batman and Bruce Wayne are the least interesting characters to the filmmakers. Batman's time on screen is incidental and his actions boring. It is a Batman film with no interest in Batman at all.

3. The Harvey Dent tough-on-crime bill has ended crime? Have you ever seen, in your lifetime, a city go from total social meltdown to utopia where the cops have nothing to do, because of a single bill that was passed? Later, when Gordon knows Dent didn't die a hero, he doesn't tell anyone, because somehow this will make the law less effective? For all his desire to make a ""real world"" superhero film, Nolan obviously has no idea about how the real world works. Toon Town in the Roger Rabbit movie had a more realistic governing set of laws.

4. Bruce Wayne is in prison forever and we hear the same damn story told over and over and over again, and it's all gender neutral so they can have one last tedious reveal at the end.

5. ""Your spinal vertebrae is sticking out of your back, here let me just punch it in! GHA! There much better. Only a matter of time before you're batman again.""

6. I once saw an episode of Vice Travel where some journalist bought a dirty bomb in Chechnya for a handful of cash. Yeah. But Bane doesn't like doing things the easy way. God forbid he just buy a bomb from a corrupt ex-soviet general. No, instead he elaborately fakes the death of a scientist (apparently the only nuclear physicist in the world, by the way), waits for Wayne to build a fusion generator beneath Gotham so he can then steal its core and use it as an atomic bomb to hold ALL OF GOTHAM hostage. Then kills the scientist.

7. It takes five months for the US to send special ops into Gotham? Really? Let's say Gotham is New York, which it is in this ponderous piece of crap. Let's say a terrorist was holding New York Hostage... for five months. You're telling me that the citizens of New York, that the military of the United States, that the nuclear scientists of the world... are going to let that happen? That the people won't rise up immediately, that the military won't have drones flying around constantly looking for radiation signatures and have infiltrated the whole damn island with special ops, that the scientists won't figure out a way to drop EMP pulse grenades across the island to shut down the mechanical device that triggers the fission explosion? Five months of just sitting on their hands?

8. An atomic explosion off the coast of Gotham, and everything's cool! No worries! Radiation fallout? Na. Poisoned ocean? Forget about it. No big deal.

9. And the worst crime of all, the co-opting of the OCCUPY RHETORIC to disenfranchise the movement. Occupy Wall St. slogans are readily and repeatedly spoken by a monstrous, mad, deceiving, mass murdering terrorist. Do we ever see the plight of the average joe in DK Rises? Never. Which is shocking since there are about 300 characters, each with more screen time than Batman. What we get is a real life political movement used in the fictional service of Kangaroo Courts, martial law, and dictatorship. I don't care if Nolan meant for Bane to be using the language of Occupy for his own corrupt and selfish ends, it's irresponsible filmmaking.

And that's just some of the eye-rolling stupidity packed into this thing.

All and all, DK Rises is tedious, boring crap."

33. The Dark Knight Rises,3/10,A waste of good talents,"What a mess. This is one of Nolan's weakest movies and definitely the worst in the Batman trilogy.

I didn't expect much from the trailer, but it was even worse than I thought. It's not terrible, but it's not a good film either.

The characters were uninteresting, plot was a mess, lots of useless fighting scenes. Tom Hardy's talent was wasted and Bane character isn't even 1% as strong or as interesting as the Joker. Most of all I liked Michael Caine's performance, but that was brief and the editor rushed his few scenes too.

Oh, and the movie is waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long. Did they really need 3 hours to tell this mess???

34. The Departed,10/10,Moles And Rats,"When The Departed finally gained for Martin Scorsese a Best Director Oscar it was felt it might have been for the work of a lifetime. It's not my favorite Scorsese film, that honor belongs to Casino for me. But it certainly was the Best Film of that year as well, rivaled in my humble opinion by Blood Diamond.

Instead of an Italian atmosphere for The Departed, Scorsese decided to use the Boston Irish who are the dominant group of that city in everything including crime. The film is simple enough, the police want to take down organized crime kingpin Jack Nicholson who plays a character named Frank Costello. That was Scorsese's little joke because the real Frank Costello was one of the Mafia overlords back in the day, although his real name was an Italian one.

Nicholson's character is based on Whitey Bulger who was the real life organized crime chieftain of the Boston area. He came from a really interesting family because a brother of his William Bulger had a long political career that culminated in that Bulger being elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate. I didn't add the word distinguished because scandal crept around that man all his life.

Getting this man won't be easy because he has a full bag of tricks. One of them being that years ago he put a young man played by Matt Damon through the Boston Police Academy, concealing a juvenile record and Damon moved gradually up the ranks and got to work in the Boston PD Internal Affairs Division. A great spot for a mole to keep an eye on pending investigations.

But the Boston PD has put one of their own undercover in the person of Leonardo DiCaprio whose family knows Nicholson from the neighborhood. At that point the whole film becomes a cat and mouse game on both sides with each having their informants on the other side. There are no dummies on either side, the police aren't keystone cops and the criminals as shrewd and brutal as they come.

Scorsese probably had a lot of help in having both Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg in the cast. Both of these players are well known for their Boston roots and they fit really well into their parts. Mark Wahlberg for his role as one of the task force trying to take Nicholson down got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He lost to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine.

Wahlberg was the only one who came up short at Oscar time. The Departed won additional Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing to go with the Best Picture And Best Director Oscars for Scorsese. Leonardo DiCaprio had a career year, he might have been nominated himself if he wasn't up for Best Actor in Blood Diamond.

The real Whitey Bulger is 80 years old now and in real life he was as full of tricks as Nicholson's character is in the film. If you think you know how this film ends, I guarantee you will be wrong. Nicholson's character has survived in many ways, that's all I can say.

Scorsese has a nice feel for Boston's atmosphere, as good as what he had for Goodfellas in New York and Casino in Las Vegas. He assembled a great cast of people who all got a crack at working with one of the best film directors of all time. The cast didn't let Martin down at Oscar time and they won't let you down when you see it on the big screen or the small."
34. The Departed,10/10,One of Scorsese's very best movies,
34. The Departed,10/10,10 out of 10 and WOW does this film deserve it! Absolutely Brilliant!!,"Blood Diamond (2006) was the film which turned me into a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, and he must have been on a roll that year as The Departed (2006) was not only made that year, but is just as good as Blood Diamond with again phenomenal acting from almost all.

The good and the bad:
The film is 14 years old at the point of writing this, and is still as good as the day it was released first saw it.
The acting is phenomenal with the award (in my opinion) going to Leonardo DiCaprio .
One of the beauties about this film is: Just as you think you've grasped what is going on it throws another twist in.
The only let down for me (and it is minor irritation) was Matt Damon, whom I'm not a fan of or his acting.


With all the great reviews it should do without saying that is outstanding! A fantastic great story, with twists and turns and that will keep you guessing to the end - and even then you will mostly have guessed wrongly.

The film has it all... suspense, thrills and tense moments... the brilliance of the cannot be overstated. A must watch!

So this is one of those rare moments where 10 out of 10 is deserved.

Recommended."
34. The Departed,10/10,Scorsese's best since Goodfellas!,"He has made good musicals (New York, New York), surreal comedies (After Hours), satires (The King of Comedy) and biopics (The Aviator), but Martin Scorsese has never done better than the times he's dealt with life on the streets and gangsters. Mean Streets, Goodfellas and Casino (and, to some degree, Taxi Driver) are proof of that. It doesn't seem strange, then, that his finest film in over a decade (Goodfellas was released in 1990) sees him return to that familiar ground. With a few changes.

The Departed, based on Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs (2002), is Scorsese's first gangster film not to feature Italian-American criminals. In fact, this film is set in Boston, where the Irish rule. One of these ""godfathers"" is Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), the man the State Police want the most. After years of investigation, they're finally getting close, thanks to undercover agent Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio). Because of his family (all Irish, all bad), becoming a member of Costello's crew isn't that difficult. Now all Costigan has to do is report to his superiors, Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg), who will pass on the information to Ellerby's (Alec Baldwin) Special Investigations Unit. What they don't know is that Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), the most promising element of said unit, has been on Costello's payroll since he was 12. Soon enough, both cops and crooks become aware of the situation, beginning a manhunt that's gonna make the already fragile Billy even more nervous and Costello increasingly crazier.

By moving from Hong Kong to Boston, Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan have made the first step in ensuring this film will be quite different from its Chinese inspiration. Another significant factor is the running time: a mere 97 minutes for Infernal Affairs, 150 for The Departed. This is due to new characters (Dignam and Costello's henchman Mr French, played by Ray Winstone, were missing in the original) and subplots, such as the one concerning Madolyn (Vera Farmiga), a psychiatrist who gets emotionally involved with both of the moles. But the most crucial difference is in the depiction of the underworld: whereas IA was stylish without being excessive, Scorsese's vision comprises very colorful language (some insults are so creative one might expect Joe Pesci to show up) and, of course, buckets of blood, the last part of the movie proving to be particularly shocking. None of the scenes ever reach the gross-out level of Casino's head-in-the-vice scene, but in pure Scorsese tradition it remains unflinchingly violent (also notable is the music, perfectly setting the mood, scene after scene, alongside Thelma Schoonmaker's impeccable editing).

Amidst these brutal surroundings, the director handles a spot-on cast: Baldwin, Sheen and Wahlberg (the latter finally back on form) make good use of their little screen time, Damon fine-tunes the edgier side he showed in The Talented Mr Ripley and the Bourne movies, and Nicholson, playing the villain again at last, delivers another OTT but classy turn (original choice Robert De Niro would probably have played the part with more calm and subtlety). A special mention is needed for Di Caprio: working with Scorsese for the third consecutive time, he has finally found a way to shake off his Titanic image, thanks to a vulnerable, gripping (and arguably career-best) performance.

With its clever plot, excellent acting and expert direction, The Departed is without doubt the year's best film so far. If this really is going to be his last gangster film (he has said so), as well as his last studio-endorsed picture, Scorsese can be proud, given the masterpiece he has given us. If only they gave him the Oscar in return..."
34. The Departed,10/10,"Amazing movie, with an ensemble cast.","Boston Police are trying to bring down Gangland boss Frank Costello, Billy Costigan goes undercover to try and nail him from the inside, but his actions are countered by Colin Sullivan, a criminal who has infiltrated The Police, handing information to Costello.

This film doesn't date, as I'm watching it, it is now seventeen years old, and apart from the flip top phones, oxycontin, and the fresh faces of DiCaprio and Damon, it has hardly dated.

Intense, fast paced, gritty and violent, it doesn't hold back for one second, I'd place The Departed in my top ten list of greatest films. The action sequences are tremendous, and there's a subtle humour rubbing through it. Even if this film doesn't quite fit into your favourite genre bracket, I suggest you still watch, it's an incredible movie.

It's one of those films that gets better with subsequent viewings, you may struggle to put some of the pieces together first time round, knowing what's happening only seems to make it more satisfying.

The cast, has there ever been a more incredible cast assembled, it's a tour de force from Jack Nicholson, but Damon, DiCaprio, Winstone, and many more are all fantastic.

10/10."
34. The Departed,10/10,Martin Scorsese Hits the Streets Again!,"Please don't make negative comments like some of the aforementioned people have been doing if you haven't seen the film yet! I have seen it, at a press screening last week. Not only is it the best film of the year so far, it marks a return to form for Martin Scorsese, and ranks with the likes of GOODFELLAS as being one of the best in his canon of films.

I'm a fan of the Hong Kong film, INFERNAL AFFAIRS, upon which this is based. While THE DEPARTED keeps the basic structure of the original, it is very much its own movie, so much so that the screenwriter, William Monahan, didn't even watch the original film while adapting its screenplay, thus enabling him to infuse the script with his, and Scorsese's, respective visions.

All the actors are first-rate (yes, even Leo, for all you DiCaprio bashers out there), and turn in some of their best performances to date. THE DEPARTED is sure to garner a host of Oscar nods, if not wins, including (hopefully) Scorsese's long-overdue statuette for Best Director. Plus, with actors like Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin playing supporting roles, that says a lot about the quality of the film they signed up for! THE DEPARTED is tough stuff, not for the faint-of-heart. That said, it is a must-see for adult viewers who long for intelligent, gritty stories to grace our movie screens once again."
34. The Departed,10/10,Superb acting on top of brilliant storytelling,"Now I know that 'The Departed' is based off of the Hong Kong movie 'WuJianDao', but Scorsese really grabs hold of a great story and brings it to the American Screen. My father grew up in Boston and when we walked out of the theater he couldn't stop talking about how authentic the environment and attitude was. Then there's the acting in which the lead actors (Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon) not only give stunningly entertaining performances, but you become engulfed in each one's perspective and dilemmas. The smaller roles that of (Baldwin, Walberg, Sheen) are supporting roles that remind me of Jesus Quintana from 'The Big Lebowski', by this I mean that their screen time is limited but they make lasting impressions that you cherish each and every scene they are in, Alec Baldwin especially. The story itself starts off with the basic intro of the players and the setting, but you'll find yourself slowing following each and every plot twist and rooting back and forth for the good guys and for the bad guys. If you're a Scorsese fan, which I am, I think you will appreciate this film. You can clearly see the Scorsese touch ranging from the cinematography and of course the music, it's great to hear ""Gimme Shelter"" again, but ""Comfortably Numb"" played in so well. It's another gangster flick from Scorsese, yet this one stands alone because feels so fresh and most would agree Scorsese does gangster films the best; so why not let him. Oscar worthy, the acting I certainly hope; this is DiCaprio's best role since 'The Aviator' which was his best role since 'Gangs of New York', am I seeing a pattern here. But my lasting impression wasn't concerned with the politics of the golden statue; my lasting impression was that I had sat through 2 and half hours of brilliant and especially entertaining storytelling. Thank you Mr. Scorsese."
34. The Departed,7/10,Scorsese Should Have Made His Own Movie,
34. The Departed,8/10,Scorsese Does it Again,"I think I would enjoy a Scorsese movie about making butter!

He's a genius and we are all lucky to have him.

Its a good story (a remake) that is largely swept to great heights by the performances of the cast.

There are over 2000 review for this movie so I don't think I need to add much.

Its really great entertainment that won't let you down.

Enjoy!

Aside from the phenomenal acting and the satisfying conclusion, I was only impressed with the simplicity of which a complex double-rat story was told.

34. The Departed,7/10,The Departed is Scorsese's most overrated film.,"Now now, before you go and comment, dislike and lambast my opinion, hear me out. This is by no means a bad film, in fact it's better than good. Yet, a ludicrous amount of film aficionados deem this as one the best films from the last decade. I'm afraid I strongly disagree. An amateur Boston cop infiltrates an American Irish gang by following the chief mobster. On the flipside, a criminal from the gang infiltrates the police department and reports the status of the investigation back to the head honcho. It's a vintage crime story that thematically conveys the power of trust. Scorsese is back to what he does best, crafting intricate mafia crime thrillers fuelled by rich character development. The arcs of the leading individuals are fully realised and are played out like a methodical game of chess. Motives are shrouded in mystery, minds are tainted by corrupted ideologies. Scorsese brings in an A-list cast comprising of Damon, DiCaprio and the ever reliable Nicholson who essentially chews up every scene like he is devouring a piece of tender chicken. Monahan's screenplay consistently brings out the gritty Boston upbringing of these characters. It's a harsh environment that lures you into this convoluted world filled with rats and tyranny. Wahlberg's sarcastic banter was a much required element to what is a tough exterior. My reasoning for not rating this excruciatingly high is the narrative structure. There are no surprises in this, it's a ""thriller"" that doesn't excite me. Purposefully indicating who the informants are in both parties at the beginning means a large duration of the film becomes predictably unexciting. It's only at its conclusion that it mistakingly tries to be enthralling by shooting people in the head (literally!). Lazily underwhelming, especially after 140 minutes of character development. The Boston accents also came across extremely heavily from certain actors, particularly Farmiga as she exclaims ""harrrrrdest!"". A well constructed crime drama that unfortunately is weighted down by a mechanical narrative."
34. The Departed,7/10,"Good, but very familiar story of cops and robbers","Remake of Infernal Affairs is not the second coming of the gangster film that some proclaimed it. It is a very good, if decidedly over long tale of cops battling robbers with moles on each side trying to remain hidden.

The plot is simple, a cop is sent undercover in the mob at the same time a crook works his way into the police force. Complicating matters is the fact that the bosses on both sides quickly realize that a rat is among and they begin the search to ferret out the mole.

The original Infernal Affairs is one of the better Hong Kong Films of the last ten years. Its a well told tale with some nice stylish twists. If the original has any flaws its that the film falls in love with itself in the second half and becomes a bit too showoffy. Thats not the case here, here the story has been refashioned and rethought into a gritty tale of Irish cops and robbers in Boston. Its different enough to discourage comparisons, which is a good thing in these days of shot for shot remakes.

Martin Scorsese has fashioned a really good film. The cast is mostly excellent, with only Jack Nicholson ruining things with an occasional lapse into stereotypical ""Jackisms"". Leonardo DiCaprio has at last arrived as an actor and turns in an excellent performance as the cop gone deep undercover. His performance is sure to garner an Oscar nomination.

I really liked this film but I didn't love it. The film carries a sense of having been down this road before, not because its a remake, as I said it different enough to rebuke comparison, rather its because it takes the gangster films of the past thirty years and compresses them together and has a very familiar feel. It reminded me of several other films about the Irish mobs, State of Grace in particular, so it didn't strike me as ground breaking the way The Godfather or Goodfellas did upon first seeing them.

My one real complaint with the film is that it takes too log to get where its going. Yes its tense and it keeps you on the edge of your seat but when it was over I felt as though I had been watching it for twice its length. A good movie should fly by and make you lose track of time. I was checking my watch through out much of the second half of this movie.

Definitely worth seeing, but I'm not sure you're going to love it, so much as you're going to like it.

34. The Departed,10/10,Fantastic Bro,"Excellent. A great, great movie. I saw it last night at a special screening and must say it was a tour de force. Even though Boston is not really a gritty town Scorsese was able to capture a darker side of the city. Coming from that area, I am always concerned when actors put on the local accent as it tends to be distracting rather than supportive. However, with local pros like Damon and Wahlberg they were able to really grab hold of it and not go overboard... most of the time. The true stand out performance has to go to DiCaprio. He has really come into his since hooking up with Scorsese, having scored a number of original performances all of which have expanded his range. He really snagged onto a deep and tragic character and created something that will hopefully be recognized come awards season. One of my favorite aspects was the friendly hostility the characters had for each other. It is a specific trademark that I have never noticed in any other city. In Boston, when you are really close with someone (or not really) it is, more or less, a requirement to bust their balls and shoot cruel insults back and forth in rhythmic banter. That detail was extensively realized in THE DEPARTED and I doubt anybody who was raised outside of the metro Boston area, or at least visited at some point, would find it nearly as hilarious as those who were. As for Scorsese's direction, I think he scored big with this one. While many have criticized that his movies have become more commercial I believe that he has just evolved. There were some classic Scorsese moments here, my favorite being a scene where DiCaprio is alone and packing his things in his apartment. Beautifully cut and stylistically directed. Is it his best effort? No. But it still is truly mesmerizing. He has created something truly special from a city that is highly underrated."
34. The Departed,9/10,Whatever I say does not do this film justice,"The Departed

The screenplay: Top Notch

The performances: all-star cast delivering all-star performances

The music: perfect

The Directing: Martin Scorsese at his finest and that is saying something.

Once again Scorsese delivers a film that meets or exceeds the expectations of its audience in nearly every way. There are moments of incredible tension, violence, and drama, moments where characters reveal their vulnerabilities and weakness. Comedic moments and moments of sadness and through it all a multi layered and brilliant story is told by an American film maker who once again proves Harvey Keitel correct when he said, ""Maybe he (Scorsese) got what he deserves--exclusion from the mediocre.""

This film is Scorsese's finest work since Raging Bull, but it is not simply about Martin Scorsese or the amazing screen play by William Monahan, it is more than an amazing score, and great cinematography. While many of the accolades for this film belong to those behind the scenes people who envisioned and directed this film. One would be remiss to not point out the great performances of an all-star cast, many of whom deliver the finest performances of long and storied careers. Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon deliver incredible performances.

However the performance that stood out for me was Wahlberg, Mark Wahlberg's Sgt. Dignam stole every scene he was in, and he shared screen time with each of the afore mentioned actors. He gets to deliver some of the best lines, and with every scene he leaves the audience wanting more, and anticipating his next scene.

Since The Academy has had its collective heads stuck  for so long, mentioning a Scorsese picture and Oscar in the same sentence seems to be a waste of time. That being said I can not say if he will finally win the Oscar that he has deserved for so long, as his major competition (Flags of our Fathers) has yet to be released, I will say that I expect to see Wahlberg nominated for best supporting, and Leo and Damon will be pitted against one another once more, this time for best actor, Monahan will be nominated for writing, and of course Scorsese will be nominated for director. Also, it goes without saying a best picture nomination will be in order for The Departed.

That was the long version; the short version is if you like a movie with incredible performances, direction, music and visuals. If you like a layered story that is not formulaic, in short if you appreciate film making and story telling at its finest then see this film. Even with the glowing reviews of myself and others, and the high expectations they will undoubtedly bring I assure you that you will not be disappointed."
34. The Departed,1/10,major let down,
34. The Departed,9/10,Whom Do You Trust?,"Wow, this was exhausting. We have a cast of characters, each of which has a dangerous side. They are woven into a complex network of crime and honor. Some are spies; some are mobsters; some are weak; and some are strong. The one thing that fills the screen is no one knows when it's coming. There is so much danger out there and it could be around any corner. The performances are great, particular by Jack Nicholson and Mark Walberg. These are a couple of crazies who seem to enjoy the most insane, continuous process of interaction among crooks and police. They are suspicious and ruthless and absolutely great. The down side is having a hell of a lot of sympathy for anyone. Leonardo DeCaprio's character is probably the most sympathetic but we know the fine line he is walking and that disturbs us. There is so much graphic violence and disrespect for humanity that it's at times hard to like it. Still, it never stops, right up to it's dramatic finish.

34. The Departed,8/10,Need more like this,"I've watched these gangster or gangster-esque movies before; goodfellas, the godfather, training day, se7en, this one (the departed) etcetera etcetera but I was too young to appreciate them or remember so watching them again now and all I can think of is why don't they make movies like this anymore. I mean they try to.

Usually when I see a cast lineup this good now first thought is ""I hope I don't get disappointed"", but in this movie the plot is just as good as the characters playing in it. And the end... often when a movie or series is full of twists and turns towards the end it's either too dramatic or just there to make up for a mediocre movie but it's perfect in this, watching this I can't think of a much better way to end it.

Great actors, great directors and great writers came together in this. It's a simple cat and mouse, cops vs gangsters thriller and it's enticing without being too complicated. What I love most is the viewer knows everything that's going on and you're just waiting to see which character in the movie is gonna figure it out first. More often than not the writers always keep a trump card in the script and you only figure it when the characters involved do which is exciting, but it's nice to see a simple thriller that keeps you at the edge of your seat like this one."
34. The Departed,9/10,Brilliant,"Before seeing this, I knew I was in for a treat, given that it's a Scorsese movie, but The Departed was even better than I expected.

The acting is outstanding. Leonardo DiCaprio gives what is quite possibly the best performance of his career. Even the people who hate him admit he did a good job. It's turned some haters into fans and my brother who despises him even says he was great. Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson give their best performances since The Talented Mr. Ripley and As Good As It Gets. Mark Wahlberg almost steals the show with the best lines. Ray Winstone, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen are good, too.

Definitely one of the best films of the 00's. And easily one of the best remakes of all time. It's intense, funny, exciting, suspenseful, superbly acted, violent, has great characters, and has one of the most shocking scenes I've ever seen. And there's not a boring moment in it's two and a half hour running time.

The film will most likely be nominated for picture, director and adapted screenplay, and in my opinion, it deserves all three of them. DiCaprio and Wahlberg also deserve nominations.

See this as soon as you can."
34. The Departed,10/10,My Heart is Still Pounding,
35. The Matrix,10/10,Just wow,"When this came out, I was living with a roommate. He went out and saw it, came home and said, ""Dude, you have to go see The Matrix."" So we left and he sat through it a second time. This movie is splendidly done. The mystery about what the Matrix is, unravels and you see a dystopian future unlike any we as a race would want. I have watched this over and over and never tire of it. Everyone does a great job acting in this, the special effects are above par and the story is engaging.

35. The Matrix,10/10,Ah yes. My first existential crisis.,
35. The Matrix,10/10,Benchmark forever.,"The Matrix - 1999

This was a real change in filmmaking. Like watching it again in 2020, i.e. after 21 years and it still feels fresh. Iconic scenes are still having benchmarks setting up.

If we say it sci-fi at its best, it won't be wrong. The hype was real, it is still not easy to match the level of Matrix where we experience the connection of humans and science, that too with amazing action fight and chase scenes, not just normal scenes they were, multiple exposures, slow motion 3D moves, Oh My God, and it's understandable as well like what are the characters up to and what storyline they are entering into. The script was very well written and executed otherwise it could have been a mess. A special appreciation in managing the theme with those black color costumes and a scientific zone with unimaginable equipment and props doing unbelievable things in the two worlds created. No spoilers, but the action scenes in the climax where the protagonist goes to save someone from agents are really breathtaking. The technology used at its best.

A salute to Wachowski Brothers and the team for creating this masterpiece. It will be a great competition and motivation as well for many films coming in the future."
35. The Matrix,10/10,The timeless classic.,"This film doesn't age, it will be contemporary even in 2030 or 2040. Wachowski's best one, by far.

35. The Matrix,10/10,A watershed moment in film-making – and what a kick-ass masterpiece,
35. The Matrix,10/10,"Agent Smith: Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You're a plague and we are the cure.",
35. The Matrix,10/10,"Immensely entertaining, intriguingly philosophical and just about one of the best films ever made!","Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.

Acting wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.

Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.

The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden in his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name, Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning ""man"" and combine this with the second part of his last name ""son"" and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination ""son of man"" which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him (and I quote): ""You're my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ."" It doesn't get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.

To all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice: Free your mind and watch the film again. You won't regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don't expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.

10/10 - on my top 3 of best films."
35. The Matrix,10/10,The Matrix Is one of the best Classic Sci-Fi Action Film ever,
35. The Matrix,9/10,A sci-fi action thriller milestone,"'The Matrix' may not be one of the very greatest examples of its genre (like '2001', 'Metropolis', 'Blade Runner', 'Back to the Future', 'Star Wars Original Trilogy', 'Alien' and 'Aliens'), but that it is revolutionary in how its visuals and use of sound broke boundaries like had never been done before cannot be denied.

It is not a film to be seen if people want character depth or relationship depth, with the forced and underdeveloped love subplot between Neo and Trinity being 'The Matrix's' sole weak spot. This ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.

Particularly striking about 'The Matrix' is its production values. Simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. So much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.

Use of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. Andy and Larry Wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even Lewis Carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.

Action is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, Kung Fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.

Keanu Reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. Carrie Anne Moss is strong. Even better are an imposingly charismatic Laurence Fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing Joe Pantoliano and a deliciously wicked Hugo Weaving.

Summing up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one. Followed by two sequels, both nowhere near in the same ball-park. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
35. The Matrix,10/10,"20 years on from release, some random thoughts on revisiting The Matrix. Spoiler: It's still brilliant.","20 years after its release, and several years since I last saw it, some reflections on the experience of rewatching The Matrix. In no particular order ...

1) It still look great. I mean, this is one amazing, stylish looking phone. Very little about the look of the film has dated - the mobile phones, obviously, Neo's computer, and very briefly a couple of visual effects creak. But otherwise, this looks as amazing at it did on release. It's sumptuous.

2) I think I was one of the many who misjudged Keanu Reeves all those yeas ago. I made easy jokes about his vacant stare and apparent intelligent. From this vantage point we can see he's been in a good number of successful, intelligent films. It's also become clear that within the industry he as a reputation as decent, hardworking man who is a pleasure to work with.

3) It's apparent again how literate and cine-literate the film is. I knew this 20 years ago, but since then I've seen a lot more films and read a lot more books, and this time around I especially loved the way the film nods its head to other film genres and influences. I noticed a lot of Peckinpah, and did I see a nod to Kurosawa there too? And I was reminded that for an English Literature graduate like me, this is a goldmine of quotes, allusions and references.

4) Seen 20 years on, its influence on cinema since is clear. There's a lot we could talk about here, but I was especially struck by how indebted a director like Christopher Nolan is (keeper of the flame of intelligent blockbusters), especially with Inception.

5) I'd forgotten that the narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about Neo's identity until just before the end. I'm not sure this really works - anyone who's read many books or ever done an anagram will not find that the most suspenseful part of the narrative.

6) Despite a run time of 2 and a quarter hours, it never flags and attention never wonders. The film fizzes with kinetic energy and the time flies by. It's a lean film, without a wasted moment.

7) The film is, of course, packed with religious allusions. When I wrote a chapter on this for my BA Theology dissertation, I said I thought the film was neo-Bhuddist (forgive the pun, please), and I stand by that on rewatching. Of course, there's lots of allusions to Christian and other theology, and The Matrix spawned some really bad reading of film by Christians which has never really stopped. When will some Christians learn to read a film/book etc with integrity and understanding of what the film is trying to do? It's a spiritually confused mish-mash of a film - but still a gloriously entertaining one.

8) All these years later, it turns out The Matrix was somewhat prophetic about the role technology would play in our lives. Humans permanently plugged in to networks? Different layers of reality that are somehow more real than what we think of as real? The Wachowskis saw all that and more coming 20 years ago. Artists are the weather vane of society; we really should learn to pay attention to them.

9) Bottom line. I still bloody love this film. I'm trying to work out if I have the requisite strength to revisit the sequels...."
35. The Matrix,9/10,One of my favorites,"At first, I wasn't interested in seeing the Matrix. But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.

I really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.

The plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.

My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away."
35. The Matrix,10/10,Exhilarating 4DX profound experience!,"So much greatness about this well done crafty philosophical masterpiece! One of the greatest films ever made; a true benchmark in cinema and huge meticulously brilliant cabinet file of important metaphors.

35. The Matrix,10/10,So well written that makes you questioning the reality. ⭐,"This movie is so well written that you can't even prove this movie is wrong about our world. This movie mades you think that our world can be just a reflection, a fake world. It's not just about the war between AI and humanity. It's more about questioning the reality.

And years later the idea is never gets old. This is the movie that you should respect if someone says ""I think this is the greatest movie of all time."" because it has somethings unique, not special it's just unique.

It's beyond all the Science-Fiction movies. Normally Sci-Fi movies mades you think ""Can this subject of the movie be real someday?"" and actually only some of them made you think that way. This one mades you think ""I can't deny, this could be our reality. We can never be sure.""

Besides making one of the greatest Fictional Universes, this movie also achieves so much more.

And not only that, this movie is also achieves something great in Action. It has the most iconic action scenes. Action director is so great. Revolutionary VFX and SFX, amazing Set Decoration and more."
35. The Matrix,9/10,"...it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.","I remember taking a class in social psychology many years ago. The Joy Luck Club figured prominently in the course. I like the idea of combining movies and theory.

I am now studying metaphysics, and any study of reality begins with René Descartes, the father of modern philosophy. Descartes began his intellectual odyssey with this question: How do we know that there is a reality outside our own minds? We each know that we have experiences, and we can be sure of these experiences; therefore, each of us can be sure that we exist. But how do we know that the internal experiences we have corresponds to objects outside our minds?

This is the whole theme of The Matrix. Watching this film is like studying metaphysics.

35. The Matrix,10/10,The world of computers,"Thomas A. Anderson is a man living two lives. By day he is an average computer programmer and by night a hacker known as Neo. Neo has always questioned his reality, but the truth is far beyond his imagination. Neo finds himself targeted by the police when he is contacted by Morpheus, a legendary computer hacker branded a terrorist by the government. As a rebel against the machines, Neo must confront the agents: super-powerful computer programs devoted to stopping Neo and the entire human rebellion.

This was excellent beginning to the franchise and probably the only good film out of the trilogy. T

The CGI was awesome, the fight scenes were cool and the acting was.

35. The Matrix,10/10,Still hip as heck even after 20 years,"You name it. Technology, CGI, flow of the story, the concept, action, romance, style, music,... everything you want is realized in this movie to the level of perfection. The scene where Neo and Trinity go to the virtual reality to save Morpheus is so fashionable that I screamed. The camera angle, costume, music, and the gunfights.. all these qualities shine the heroes. The entertainment value of this movie should not be overlooked because of its high quality and philosophy.

I can see how much research Wachowski sisters put in to make their imaginations and concepts realized in the two-hour movie in plausible ways. How is dystopian future and present is connected? How does dream within a dream work? All the questions about their imaginary world is answered because they pay attention to details and they explain every existence and terms with logic one step at a time. There is no leap of logic, very tightly well-woven script.

Their concept is not just future or imaginary anymore. In 2020, we see AI taking over many of works and jobs that humans used to do and invading privacy. Virtual reality games gain popularity over time, and you see Neo everywhere who adapts quickly in the Internet world and learn the combat game so fast and naturally.

The impact of 'The Matrix' in the movie industry is more than imaginable. Of course, revolutionary visual effects with elaborated CGI techniques created iconic bullet-dodging scene of Neo. Because the Matrix system in the movie is kindly well-explained, it widens a scale of sci-fi genre. Hunger Games, Inception, Eagle Eye, Wall-E, and so many other movies that followed benefited from this epic work."
35. The Matrix,10/10,Welcome to the Real World.,"Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.

The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.

The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.

The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow-motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.

In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made."
35. The Matrix,10/10,The benchmark for all sci-fi films to come,"The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.

Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre. There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.) There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects. With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync. Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition. Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.

But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes. The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky. The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of. The photography was breathtaking. (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.) And the acting? Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did. But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting. As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked! Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne. His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.

People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation. My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE. What is the Matrix, you ask? Something that's closer to reality than you think.

Either that or it's my personal choice for best film of all-time."
35. The Matrix,10/10,Matrix - one of the greatest ever - in same league as The Shawshank Redemption & Interstellar,"What to say about the Matrix which has not already been said ? Sheer brilliance in every department. Those seeing faults in CGI can they come to terms with the fact this Universe looks exactly like it's meant to be real or unreal ? Why correlate with our Universe & how we see it ? 😊 Also, as for finding faults - well it's your limited understanding that you can't see the sheer beauty of Matrix Universe, concept of Maya, free will & choice. Matrix is not a film, it's a revolution. You don't get it now, one day you surely will, one day.... 😊

35. The Matrix,10/10,Almost my favorite movie ever! The metaphors/quotes should be more known!,"Truly a masterpiece in every way! If it wasn't for Fight Club this would my favorite; I've been on the fence about it. The Matrix along with They Live have the best metaphors about life/society, most of which a lot of the population aren't woke to!

For example the entire speech Morpheus says ""The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. That you are a slave, Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind."" Among other brilliant quotes like when he talks about what the world has become, then mentions we have become this referring to a battery. So many genius lines I could list that I won't.

The effects, stunts, lighting, sounds, and tone are outstandingly spot on! They really did train for the fight sequences for months I've seen all the special features plus more. Yes this is a sci-fi film, but I see it as a documentary as well. We're all slaves that take the blue pill throughout many things it's just hard to realize that. I also love what someone else said, it's a benchmark for sci-fi to come, that is very true and it's the last of its kind; movies aren't made like this anymore!

A lot of people worked hard to make this film what it is. I respect that; I've always wanted to work on film just haven't had a way for many reasons. If you've read this far or even at all thanks and sorry! I usually don't leave a review this long, just thought it was worth it for this one. Check out my others if you're interested for now 10 out of 10 phenomenal movie in many ways!"
35. The Matrix,9/10,Wow! I Finally Saw It!,"This is one of those movies that ""everyone"" has seen, except me. I tried to watch it with some friends about fifteen years ago, but they had two kids under five years old and I was only able to ingest it in five minute increments. So a friend lent me the video and I finally got a chance to see it. It's a pretty remarkable film. The premise of an alternative reality works here where it often fails. Keanu Reeves is a sort of messiah, not by his own choosing originally. He has been attacked and abused by men in sunglasses whom, we find out later, are a part of a representation of Artificial Intelligence. The side Neo ends up on are the original humans whose ranks have been nearly driven to extinction. Laurence Fishburne is the leader of the rebels and he believes the the Reeves character is ""the One."" I thoroughly enjoyed it but would have like a little more creative final scene. Too many shell casings. Apparently, weaponry didn't advance much in twenty years. But, it keeps one on edge with its special effects and its non-stop action.

36. Back to the Future,10/10,So good in so many ways,"I love Back to the Future. While having a typical 80s feel to it, which I like, I love how fun, irresistible and original the film is. The special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sly and sophisticated. Helping along the way is a script that is pretty ingenious, the sort of script that has quotable lines and also pokes fun at 1950s icons and lifestyles during the frequent bouts of time travelling. The score by Alan Silvestri elevates the sense of fun to a greater level, the main theme is one of the most memorable themes ever in the history of film, or so I think anyway. Robert Zemekis's direction is very good, and the cinematography, scenery and costumes are also excellent. And I have to mention the acting, Michael J Fox is really appealing in the role of Marty McFly, the role that propelled him to stardom, and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in one of his most memorable roles(and yes this includes Judge Doom from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and Professor Plum from Clue). Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are also great. Overall, brilliant film that is good in so many ways. 10/10 Bethany Cox

36. Back to the Future,10/10,How could anything be more fun than this?,"Back To The Future is such an inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking that it is impossible to forget about it. The casting of every character involved was absolutely perfect, and the performances were spectacular. I first saw this film when I was six years old, and it is the only movie that I know of that I don't think I could ever get sick of.

One of the best things about Back To The Future is that it really makes you think. You can have in-depth conversations about the plausibility of the story-line and spend hours discussing the film. The story is awesome, it is delivered cleverly and entertainingly, and the movie as a whole is just so much FUN that it can be forgiven whatever number of time-travel discrepancies that may be found in the plot.

I cannot recommend this movie enough. I have never found a movie other than this one that provides such a huge dose of great fun, and it has the desirable quality where you are able to see something new each time you see it. The only problem is that they stopped at part III."
36. Back to the Future,10/10,Great movie,"One of the last movies I went with sister to see back in 86. The film blew my mind. My friends never wanted to see this one. I was happy I went. Many year's latter, I bought ""Back to the Future"" at Mc Donalds for $2.99 or for some other low price with a meal. The film ages well, and I love it just the same. The director and screen writer mixes science fiction, humor, and action perfectly. A big component of the script is time line theory which drives the story. Marty has many problems to fix, and finds out more than anyone wants to know about their parents. Michael J Fox and Christopher Loyd were excellently casted. Marty and Doc what a chemistry. With the film series one see the many dualities with time travel, that become a constant with the movie. The town clock, being awoke in a strange place, and letters. Keep this in mind when watching the 2 other sequels. The theory that time repeats itself is evident. What a time machine, the Delorian adds to this movie. Worth watch over again. 10 out of 10! Thank you TBS for showing all 3 films.

36. Back to the Future,10/10,A classic masterpiece the original the only best my favorite time travel film of all time,"What can I say about this movie that was already said? It is my favorite time travel sci-fi, adventure epic comedy in the 80's and I love this movie to death! When I saw this movie I was thrown out by its theme. An excellent sci-fi, adventure epic, I LOVE the 80s. It's simple the greatest time travel movie ever happened in the history of world cinema. I love this movie to death, I love, LOVE, love it!

I firstly saw this movie in the early 90's as a kid on VHS tape and I was blow away by the action and the score and the title back to the future. This movie is one of the best masterpiece time travel epic adventure film. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fantastic at acting. Music theme score by Alan Silvestri is excellent I could listen to it whole day.

Back to the Future (1985)

From the Academy Award ""- winning team of Steven Spielberg"" and Robert Zemeckis** comes the hilariously groundbreaking adventure that thrilled critics and audiences alike - and sparked one of the most successful movie trilogy ever! Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty's assistance for his new invention.

At that night Marty went to assist Doc's invention the Time traveling Car ""DeLorean"". Marty was told to record Doc's first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.

After killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.

What will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.

They really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.

More than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines's two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost ""chewed every scenes"" in the movie. Mr. Lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.

Last but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance. Above all I want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn't be made without the songs ""The Power of Love,"" and ""Earth Angel"".

The rating I am giving is 10/10 the original and the best one of all time. I love this film, it is my favorite time travel movie of all time and I love it to death! All in all it is the greatest sci-fi, romantic movie of all time. It is the part of the great Movie History, which consider itself as "" A Modern/Classic Masterpiece! """
36. Back to the Future,10/10,A film you can watch time and time again.,"My DVD of Back To The Future is like my own personal time machine: I hit play on the remote and I'm instantly whisked back to 1985, when hair was big, fashion was fugly, films were fun and I was a mere 17 years of age with my whole adult life ahead of me.

Nostalgia certainly plays a big part in my continued enjoyment of the film, and was clearly at the forefront of the minds of producer Steven Spielberg and director Robert Zemeckis, who delight in recreating the 50s of their youth, but the film is much, much more than a simple trip down memory lane: it's a rollicking adventure, a charming love story, and a brilliant comedy, with a career-defining performance from Michael J. Fox as time-travelling teen Marty McFly, fine support from the lovely Lea Thompson, quirky Crispin Glover and crazy Christopher Lloyd, amazing special effects (for the time) from ILM, and a rocking 80s soundtrack.

A wonderful film that is as fresh and entertaining today, despite its inescapable 80s style, I have no doubt that Back To The Future will continue to captivate audiences young and old well after my generation is history: my kids sure loved it, and I hope that when they have kids of their own, theirs will too. And theirs, and theirs, and theirs..."
36. Back to the Future,10/10,An '80s classic that never disappoints,"I admit to having grown up on 1980s films and thus having a special admiration for them. Whichever way you look at it, BACK TO THE FUTURE is one of the most intelligent of the Hollywood blockbusters from that era, a film which perfectly merges crowd-pleasing entertainment with a complex and well-written storyline that gets to grips with the thorny subject of time travel.

The underrated Michael J. Fox stars in the role of his life as Marty McFly, a guy who unwisely gets involved in time travel thanks to the machinations of his kooky inventor buddy, Doc Brown. Christopher Lloyd essays this subsidiary character and, again, it's the role of his life; he's over the top in it but nonetheless his character is thoroughly endearing and never less than hilarious.

The time travel aspects of the storyline are carefully worked out and hold together very well even today, some 30 years after release. What I particularly liked about this film is the calibre of the writing: there's no slow spots or simplicity here, just one suspenseful sub-plot after another. There are small moments, big set-pieces, cutting edge special effects, action, chase scenes, romance, and of course plenty of humour, and a quirky supporting cast who make the most of their roles. BACK TO THE FUTURE is a classic - and for good reason."
36. Back to the Future,9/10,Gets Better With Age,"A young man (Michael J. Fox) is accidentally sent thirty years into the past in a time-traveling DeLorean invented by his friend, Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), and must make sure his high-school-age parents unite in order to save his own existence.

After almost thirty years (2014), this film loses none of its charm, and actually gains respect. The movie has had such a strong impression on everyone, whether they have seen it or not, as it completely permeated pop culture.

The script is genius, not only how it parallels 1955 and 1985 (some of the references are dynamite), but how it set the scene for the sequels (despite allegedly not intending to have any). This is just one clever gag after another, and may require repeated viewings to catch them all.

36. Back to the Future,10/10,Huge fun.,"Back to the future is the ultimate 1989's movie, if you're feeling nostalgic, or simply want to experience the flavour of the decade, then this is the movie for you.

A young Michael J Fox is sent back to 1955 by his friend, Dr Emmett Brown, his very existence threatens his own future, he has to fight for life as he knows it.

It's super fast paced, it's one of those movies that simply flies by, it's fully of action, full of laughs, it's very much the 80's poking fun at the 50's, the free and carefree lifestyle of 1985 showing how things have changed in three decades.

Wonderful special effects, lots of pyrotechnics and action sequences to enjoy. The music is wonderful, you'll be singing along.

The acting is superb, Michael J Fox is just great as Marty, Christopher Lloyd is awesome as the wild eyed Doc.

I would say it's the perfect Boxing Day film, but it's one of those awesome movies that you'll enjoy any time, and with the whole family.

A fabulous movie.

10/10."
36. Back to the Future,10/10,Absolute Classic,"As a child, I used to watch this movie religiously. I loved the chemistry between Doc Brown and Marty McFly, I loved the all too familiar soundtrack and the ridiculous way in which George McFly laughs. This movie has become such a nostalgic and feel-good film for me. I had the good fortunate to see all three 'Back to the Future' movies in cinema last year and it was such an experience to watch this timeless classic with people who enjoy this film as much as I do. Everyone has to see this film at least once in their life! Such an amazing, funny Sci-Fi from the 1980's. I just can't get enough of this movie - it will just never get old. Cannot recommend it enough!

36. Back to the Future,10/10,Part 1-Goodness gracious! Great balls of fire!,"I just asked my friend that I'm speaking with through instant messenger if he had ever seen ""Back to the Future"" and he said ""Yeah, who hasn't?"", sadly, I never had the opportunity until tonite and he called me a failure as a movie buff, well, at least I've seen the movies now! Ha ha! I'm back on track! Well, obviously, this is my first review for the first Back to the Future and when I came her to IMDb, I knew this was a well loved movie, I was just amazed at it being on the top 250, but I can't give it a lower rating because Back to the Future was an excellent film that was ground breaking for it's time and still today.

Marty McFly and his good friend, The Doc, are two science nuts. Marty isn't really happy with his home life and the fact that he and his parents are very square and strict, The Doc calls Marty and shows him his latest invention, his De Lauren that he built into a time machine. When the government go after The Doc and Marty has to get away, he jumps in the car and goes back to the year of 1955, when his parents met. Instead of the way his mom and dad met happening to his dad, he ends up being in the position and mom ends up falling for her son, not even knowing! But he has to make sure his parents are together in time so he can get back without altering the future.

Back to the Future to this day is still a timeless treasure that I notice more and more is becoming part of a newer generation. Michael J. Fox should be proud, his work will be remembered for a long time. Back to the Future worked so well because of the great story and the humor was great, the whole cast worked together and made a terrific movie that will be looked back on thirty years from now and still be considered cool.

10/10"
36. Back to the Future,9/10,Let your imagination fly,"A funny sci-fi? Unusual but here it not only works but does so spectacularly. A whimsical but very clever time travel story that bedazzles you leaving you wanting more.

The charasmatic Michael J Fox plays a wonderful bumbling high schooler searching for love, a guitar gig and his existence which he himself threatens to erase.

Clever and humourous references litter this fun flick; references which are further improved upon in the sequels. Views of the same scenes from different angles, different perspectives and different timelines abound.

Fun for the entire family.

36. Back to the Future,9/10,Great Scott! Back to the Future is a great time-travel movie!,
36. Back to the Future,10/10,The Lost Blockbuster,"Back to the Future is one of those rare, almost forgotten, pieces of pop culture that, surprisingly, draws little attention to itself. Unlike such notable gimmicks as Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jaws, and Independence Day, there aren't any low-budget leeches trying to imitate off this work and cash-in on its success. This is due to the near flawless script. Why it didn't win an Oscar, you're guess is as good as mine. Making a time-travel storyline as in this movie that doesn't fall into plot holes the size of Terminator's is exceptionally difficult. I'd know.

The film starts slow, and gradually accelerates as it progresses. You could almost call it a Jerry Bruckheimer movie for kids with Spielberg's trademark nostalgia. The characters themselves are typical stereotypes for a movie like this and none of them, not even Marty himself, gel with potential. In some ways it's as if MAD magazine made the film in an attempt to be serious.

With such an automotive obsession as this film has, one must wonder if George Lucas was involved.

Overall, I have to praise this movie for its inventiveness and originality, even if it created most of our time-travel cliches. 4 out of 5 stars. Well worth your time."
36. Back to the Future,10/10,1.21 giga watts of awesomeness,
36. Back to the Future,10/10,As close as you can get to a perfect movie,"I feel that there is no such thing as a perfect film,but in today's cinema,""Back to the Future"" comes amazingly close.It has laughs, AND thrills,always a great combination.I am amazed at the attention paid to nearly every single detail here.For example,at the start of the film,Doc and Marty are in the parking lot of the ""Twin Pines Mall"".Then,shortly after Marty arrives in 1955,he accidently runs over one of old man Peabody's beloved pine trees.Toward the end, after Marty returns,the name of the mall changes.This is something you just don't notice until you see the film several times as I have. Excellent casting,particularly Christopher Lloyd as the unforgettable Doc Brown,the humor of the Ronald Reagan bit and the Johnny B. Goode sequence,along with the ultimate heart pounding ending and the attention to detail as I mentioned make this film as close to perfect as you will see in modern cinema.The sequels? Forget them.This is the only one of the trilogy you need to see.

36. Back to the Future,9/10,Proof that Hollywood once was capable of putting magic on film,"I watched this movie again for about the seventh time after a 10 year lapse or so. If there ever was magic on screen, Back to the Future has it. By the end of the film, I was only thinking, ""Wow, Hollywood was once capable of putting magic on the screen."" It really makes you wonder if the best of Hollywood is behind us.

To summarize a few components of the movie: The storyline and plot are superb, even with the minor plot holes. The acting is spot on in every scene. Today's film editors should watch this film a hundred times to see what editing should really be like, nearly flawless. The direction is unbelievable in my opinion. The screen writing and script are perfect as well and will make you laugh and smile throughout the movie. Every line by the awkward McFly family, every crazy rumbling of ""Doc"", and even the cheesy bully taunts of Biff fit together so well.

When I sat down to watch this movie a few days ago, I expected to see an aged movie that I remembered being much better than it actually was. I'm so glad I was wrong."
36. Back to the Future,10/10,Best Part of a the Best Movie Ever,"When you talk about Back to the Future, you have to talk about the whole trilogy. Because Zemeckis and Gale didn't make sequels they extended the length of one film, which is very different than a sequel.

The ultimate film must allow the audience feel part of the film and relate to the characters. This film is the best because it takes a fantasy story and makes it adaptable to real-life. I don't know how soon anyone will be able to time-travel, but you can relate to Marty McFly's (Michael J. Fox) reaction to the change. Even if you're not a teenager you can believe it in someway. Back to the Future is the perfect and its been extended into a masterpiece with 2 sequels or extensions as I see it. Definitely a must see, if your pathetic enough not to have seen in at least the last 8 years.

Amazing story by Gale and Zemeckis. Great acting especially by Michael J. Fox, but also great work by Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and Tom Wilson. Such an exciting an involved story."
36. Back to the Future,9/10,So Much Fun,"Lots of tongue in cheek. Some great characterization. A chance at redemption. These movies showed Michael J. Fox to be a wonderful comedic presence. It is sad what happened to him, but can there be a more impressive example of a person who has overcome the tribulations that life has given him. Whenever I see him in ""The Good Wife"" as the slimy, underhanded character lawyer he plays, I love that I can ""not like"" a man who is dealing with devastating Parkinson's. As the principle character in this movie, Marty is shoved from one situation to another in a time he only can guess at. He has to face the youth of his father, a febrile wimp who gets pushed around. Then, of course, there is the wonderful Christopher Lloyd as the professor. While one could never accuse this film of being true science fiction with all the implications of time travel, there is a kind of suspense that works very well. It's pure fun and is the best of the three films in my opinion.

36. Back to the Future,9/10,Pure Genius,
37. Avengers: Endgame,7/10,Not as good as infinity war..,"But its a pretty good film. A bit of a mess in some parts, lacking the cohesive and effortless feel infinity war somehow managed to accomplish. Some silly plot holes and characters that could've been cut (Ahem, captain marvel and thanos). The use of Captain marvel in this film was just ridiculous. Shes there at the start, bails for some reason? And then pops up at the end to serve no purpose but deux ex machina a space ship...

The past thanos part wasn't necessary when you think about it, they could've done this film without a real 'villain' And it would've worked and been a original take on a super hero film without using the same formula we have seen in 10+ super hero films already. The entire final battle felt like a rehashed messy battle, with a bunch more characters against thanos - basically mixing the space battle from infinity war; iron man, spider man etc and the final battle of infinity war with captain america, thor etc.. mashing those two into one within this new film. The scenes of trying to pull the gauntlet off his hand.. it all felt like a rehash.

To me the best part of the film was the first act and half of the second, when everyone is lost and trying to figure out how to continue on. really interesting themes that followed the pay off from infinity wars ending. And then the time heist part. Tho the heist part should've been much more stretched out. With only small parts of thanos within that, and not having him be the big bad again. But just a side character that gets in the way a little bit.

And the setting up for 'new avengers' to replace the beloved actors and characters we have come to associate with these films.. they do not get me at all excited for the next phase in marvel films. Falcon, Valkyrie, blackpanther, cap marvel? I just dont care about them at all. And their actors lack any charisma or depth.

To me this feels like a closing of marvel films that I'll really enjoy for my pop corn fix. I've given infinity war a 10/10 and some of the stand alone films 8's and 9's. But I have a sinking feeling this will not be happening in the future except the guardians of the galaxy films.

It seems i maybe in the minority for my feelings towards this film, but im not sugar coating my opinion like it seems a few people are doing due to nostalgia. Its good, but not great. Had the opportunity to be better, maybe? And the setting up of new characters to come possible reflects on my score to... Because i just don't give two cents about any of them"
37. Avengers: Endgame,8/10,Not as good as infinity war but a great movie,
37. Avengers: Endgame,7/10,Success does not equal quality,
37. Avengers: Endgame,10/10,Crazy in every sense,"This film is an emotional rollercoaster with some of the coolest superhero plot lines ever drawn up. It's straight up the most epic Marvel film that will probably ever be created. I don't see how Marvel could ever top this, but getting to see these characters all together at least one last time was a reward all on its own.

37. Avengers: Endgame,10/10,The End of an Era!,"After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.

On the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.

Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.

Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.

Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10"
37. Avengers: Endgame,10/10,Great,
37. Avengers: Endgame,10/10,The ending made all 22 movies worth it,"If you're going to watch this movie, avoid any spoilers, even spoiler free reviews. Which is why I'm not going to say anything about the movie. Not even my opinion. All I'm going to say is:

The crowd applauded 3 times during the movie, and stood up to clap their hands after. This I have never witnessed in a Dutch cinema. Dutch crowds aren't usually passionate about this. I checked the row where I was sitting, and people were crying. After the movie, I was seeing people with smudged mascara. That's all I have to say about the movie.

37. Avengers: Endgame,7/10,Emotional but bit messy.,
37. Avengers: Endgame,8/10,A little bit underwhelmed,"Don't get me wrong, the movie was great, but would I watch it a second time? Probably not - until the DVD comes out.

I've seen infinity war at least 5 times, and it's one of my favorite films.

That being said, i will compare the two movies for sure, and I just disliked the pacing, it was all over the place. Some Characters felt off, and some got little to no screen time, where others had too much.

It's just too many characters for one movie, even though infinity war did it much better, with just as many characters. I just can't put my finger on it.

The fighting scenes were alright, the first half lacked action, but the second half delivered some good solid scenes, nothing groundbreaking, but fun to watch. They can't reinvent the wheel, neither do they want to. They stick to what works, and that's alright.

All in all, the movie was a close 8/10, the fanboys who give it a 10 are just blind to accept the mistakes the movie made. It's not a perfect film, even an 8 is really generous in my opinion. The Movie works with nostalgia and gives fans of the MCU the things they wanted, more or less.

Still thinking Thor 3 was the best MCU movie. Sue me."
37. Avengers: Endgame,6/10,Not the Endgame I hoped for,
37. Avengers: Endgame,4/10,"The writers got carried away, the directors over reached and the studio sacrificed the integrity of their product.",
37. Avengers: Endgame,9/10,The zenith of the MCU franchise.,"I feel like I'm wasting my time writing down my thoughts about Avengers: Endgame, because nothing I (or any critic) could say about it would ever dissuade a prospective viewer from seeing it. But after having had the chance to watch it at a preview screening, I can't help but say a few spoiler-free words.

I'm not your average fanboy -- most long-running franchises have bored me at this point, and I couldn't care less about the newest Star Wars episode or whether there will be another film set in the Harry Potter universe.

But Marvel films have been consistently watchable, with many solid entries and a few great ones (Winter Soldier, Ragnarok, the first Guardians of the Galaxy among others). And after Infinity War ended with a cliffhanger, I was looking forward to the conclusion. Boy, was I not disappointed!

Very few highly-anticipated movies live up to the hype, but Avengers: Endgame is one of them. It's the perfect follow up to Infinity War, and the absolute zenith of the Marvel franchise. It's hard to see how they'll be able to top this one.

It's surprisingly inventive (even when you know where the story is headed, the plot takes a few tangents getting there), emotionally engaging (a few people were crying in the theater) and surprisingly funny (this is probably the most I've laughed in a Marvel film since Thor: Ragnarok). Visually speaking, it's a true spectacle (topping Infinity War in the 'epic battle' stakes), and even though it's three hours long, it doesn't feel bloated. The only times I glanced at my watch was because I was hoping there would be more time before the end.

Yes, it's a superhero movie, but an immensely entertaining one (especially for fans who have seen all the pictures that came before it: there are tons of references and inside jokes to reward the faithful).

If ""Return of the King"" managed to win Best picture at the 2003 Oscars Avengers: Endgame deserves at least a nomination. It's as good (and in many ways better) a conclusion to a fantasy/genre series as the Peter Jackson film,.

Go see it."

37. Avengers: Endgame,9/10,Very disappointing,"Right in the beginning, you know how the movie is going to end...the good guys are going to win. How anti-climactic that was.. The stage is not set right (half of all humanity is gone, but the enormity of that is not explored...)...when you have Thanos give his explanation as to why he did what he did, I found myself thinking - well, he actually has a point. In the meanwhile, every single superhero is given time to fight, say some cute things, some say a few smart things, a few even manage to say profoundly philosophical statements... The quantum physics explanations used to explain how things are done, are plainly non sense... ..they just made stuff up as they went on. Alls well that ends well. Except we spent 3 hours to find that out.

37. Avengers: Endgame,7/10,Pure torture,"I had to take several breaks, walk the dogs, play videogames and clean the house, while watching this absolutely ridiculous and nonsensical pile of rubbish and now afterwards, I'm asking myself why I put myself through such suffering. To what end. I guess I was hoping there would be one scene or at least one line that put a smile on my face or made me feel anything at all except extreme pain and boredom. There wasn't any of that unfortunately, so I just wasted three hours of my life I could have spent on basically anything else and it would have been more worth while. I can't decide which one was more painful to watch, this or Aquaman? Both equally and utterly disappointing I guess.

37. Avengers: Endgame,4/10,Time travel is such a lazy way to write stories,
38. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,10/10,"""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a bizarre but wonderful movie, a very strange and remarkably tender experience.","""How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd."" - Alexander Pope

Michel Gondry's ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a bizarre but wonderful movie, a very strange and remarkably tender experience, which I suppose is only to be expected from screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, the man behind ""Being John Malkovich.""

The film was produced by Focus Features (""Lost in Translation,"" ""21 Grams""), a company which strives to offer original, quality films to the true cinema lovers. If the company keeps producing films this good, they may become hugely successful in the future, if not already.

The previews portrayed the movie as a bouncy, cheery comedy in the vein of ""Adaptation,"" the last film written for the big screen by Charlie Kaufman, when it is really a tender movie about love and romance. This is Jim Carrey's best performance to date, and may open the eyes of his prejudiced haters who have only imagined him as Ace Ventura and a certain cable guy for his entire career. No snippy quotes, outrageous humor or bizarre antics in ""Sunshine"" -- Carrey plays a true, realistic, three-dimensional character named Joel Barrish, who plans to have memories of his girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet), erased by a new company called Lacuna, after he discovers that she herself has had the procedure performed only a week before. Joel meets with the company's founder, Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), and is informed that the procedure -- although ""technically"" brain damage -- is on par with a heavy night of drinking. ""Nothing you'll miss much,"" he is told, as he plunges into a bizarre world of long forgotten memories.

The entire process of the operation is quite fascinating, really, if a bit reminiscent of an idea founded by none other than one of Kaufman's favorite writers, Philip K. Dick, who wrote the source short story for the Ah-nuld movie ""Total Recall."" All items relating to the person you want erased from your brain are assembled together, and the technicians at Lacuna (Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood) then ""map"" an outline of your memories, which are supposedly stemmed together. I have my doubts about the seriousness and remote possibility of such a procedure being performed, and the explanation is quite simply utter bull, but we don't care because the entire erasing of Joel's memories serves as a backdrop for a deeper meaning: If you could forget about past romances, would you really want to? And if so, would you be willing to sacrifice all the good ones, along with the bad ones?

The conclusion that ""Sunshine"" arrives at is, to be totally truthful, as honest as can be. During the procedure, Joel's subconscious realizes that it doesn't want to let go of its memories of Clementine, and so begins a strange labyrinth of fragmented memories, constantly changing surroundings, and mental materializations of Clementine. The movie is like a very bizarre dream, when you're trying to interact with people, but they're not responding, and you shout and try to get their attention but they don't seem to notice. Joel's entire odyssey of the interior of his mind makes ""Being John Malkovich"" look normal -- but as I didn't like ""Malkovich"" very much, and thought its strangeness was unjustified, it fits perfectly in ""Sunshine"" -- there are some great special effects, such as when Joel is wandering through his own memories, drifting in and out of sleep, hearing the voices of the technicians erasing his memories and watching as objects and areas around him vanish and deconstruct. It's so bizarre but yet also so beautiful. Gondry was a former music video director (his complete works are available on DVD) and he is the perfect candidate for this project, having worked with Kaufman before on the 2001 flop ""Human Nature."" It seems that he has finally found a unique directing style that ties in perfectly with the underlying themes of the movie.

There is a very deep message in ""Sunshine,"" and it is arguably Kaufman's deepest film to date. Love and romance and memories of both have rarely been examined as thought-provokingly and tenderly as they are in this wonderful motion picture. The movie has a very profound message that all viewers should pay attention to. There are many small intricacies in the film, surely picked up on more thoroughly on repeat viewings, and the entire construction of the movie is completely enthralling and intelligent. I saw two people leave the rather empty theater during the screening I attended. It tanked in the US and I predict it will do the same in the UK, which is a shame, because this is the smartest film of 2004 and has the most to say about our lives than any other film this year. While everyone flocks to see the new Denzel Washington action movie, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is forgotten, which is quite depressing -- people would rather spend their money on forgettable entertainment than view something unique that has something important at its core.

I think what the movie finally asks us after its long, emotional journey, is would we want our own memories erased? And if so, what would the consequences be? A lesser film might examine this idea poorly -- ""Sunshine"" is not. It is perfect in almost every conceivable way, and anyone who complains that it is not original must be joking -- in my entire lifetime, this is one of the most unique film experiences I have ever had.

""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is a beautiful movie, eloquently voiced by Gondry, firmly constructed and rooted in an eerie nightmarish fantasy land where anything is possible. It's beautiful, it's bizarre, it's exceptional, it's funny, it's lovely, it's touching, it's witty, and it's one of the best movies I have ever seen."
38. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,10/10,Meet me in Montauk...,
38. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,10/10,an modern artistic triumph for all involved,"Michel Gondry, credited as the director and co-writer of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, is only partly responsible for the success that the film achieves. He implements a awe-inspiring blend of style to a story that is perfectly non-linear. But then there is also the madman genius of the current screen writing plane- Charlie Kaufman- who has written three of the most ingenious, funny, and human of ""little"" Hollywood movies (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind).

He understands, and perhaps likely experienced to a degree, what a relationship holds to- the truth, to understanding, and then when it ends, how out memory changes the relationship. Enter in the concept that makes 'Eternal Sunshine' something of a un-official science fiction film - the Lacuna corporation, led by Tom Wilkinson's character, can erase just one person out of your memory, all of the experiences that you and the significant other had. So, when Joel (Jim Carrey) goes in to erase his memory of Clementine (Kate Winslet) after finding out she did just the same, he enters into a mind-warp. He goes through memories they had, happy ones, sad ones, some that are just what makes up what you have emotionally with the one you've loved. And sometimes, and to the behest of the assistants of Lacuna (Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo), Joel doesn't want them all to be erased.

As I mentioned, the plot is non-linear, which could've gone the wrong way if not done with skill. With a film like 21 Grams, which has a talented director and cast, the non-linear structure isn't necessary. But it's an asset that the story doesn't start from A to Z. To assist Gondry with this, he has the extraordinary Ellen Kuras as DP and Valdís Óskarsdóttir, an editor from Iceland. Their collaboration is crucial with Gondry and Kaufman (and co-writer Pierre Bismuth), as they bring all of these un-real images a real quality. Quite simply, there isn't a finer example of surrealism crossbred with realism in any other American film so far this year. The usage of lights, cuts, and with the kinds of special effects not expected (i.e. no CGI), add to the effect it has on a viewer. That the characters of Joel and Clementine are as enveloping as they are is also a credit to Kaufman.

But then there's one more part that completes the success of the film - the acting. Jim Carrey, very simply, is at his very best. He finds a balance from certain scenes in being like people we see everyday, feeling low, not much of interest, inward. And then when the memory erases begin, we get to see him act funny, but not like the kind of humor he brought with Ace Ventura or Dumb and Dumber. This is Carrey knowing this character just well enough to play off his counterpart, played by Winslet. She, meanwhile, is perhaps at her best. Her character is eccentric, funny, insightful, and wanting. She pulls it off. As do the supporting actors.

There's not much more I can say about this film, except to say that even after seeing it three times, I feel like I could watch it over and over and see a new shot, a new sequence, and new set of emotions tied to things. It's one of the great romantic dramedies of the decade."
38. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,10/10,Perfect - a movie that puts 99% of all contemporary movies to shame,"There's only one way to describe ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"": perfect. It's been one week since I saw the movie and I still cannot stop thinking about it. Was the ending happy or sad? I cannot tell, but it's deeply touching.

Charlie Kaufman is incredible. How does he come up with all these original, flawless scripts? Finally there's someone who uses the possibilities of cinema to the fullest. I love the way Kaufman shows the fate of individuals and derives universally true rules from it. The content of his story is always highly philosophical without ever being smart alec.

Some say ""Eternal Sunshine..."" was over-directed. I disagree. Having read the script, I know that Gondry deserves lots of credit for bringing this beautiful story to life. Sure, there are five creepy images per minute, but have you ever seen such an original, weird picture? Mind you, I'm not saying that lots of effects automatically make for a good direction, but in this case it really helped to underline the story, not distracting from it.

Jim Carrey... wow! I've always liked him as the hilarious Comedian he is, but I never thought that his performances in ""The Truman Show"" and ""Man On The Moon"" were that much of a departure from his funny-man side. As Joel, however, he is a completely different person. It's like Jim Carrey had a serious twin brother. Unbelievable. I bow to this performance! Give this man more chances to show his acting abilities, I say!

Finally I have to mention Beck's cover of ""Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometime"", which fits perfectly into the movie and won't leave my CD-Player for the next months.

A movie like ""Eternal Sunshine..."" really shows how much time and money Hollywood wastes on producing crap like ""Bad Boys"" or ""The Fast & The Furious"", and its box office result demonstrates how little people care about quality in movies. Personally, I have found my first contender for best motion picture of the year. I need to see the movie again, because I have a feeling that this one gets even better with each viewing. I can't wait until it's released on DVD.

I feel the need to say more, but I can't put my feelings into (English) words. All I can say is: GO SEE THIS MOVIE! You won't regret it."
38. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,10/10,Absolutely wonderful,"When I first saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, I wasn't expecting to love it, let alone like it. What a surprise when I saw it! I think this film is wonderful in every aspect, truly beautiful and packs a full emotional punch. In fact, if you don't mind me saying so, it is one of my favourite films of the 2000s.

I especially loved how Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was shot. The whole film looks beautiful, not only with the cinematography which is indeed spellbinding but also in the scenery which was nothing short of amazing. Another impressive asset was the soundtrack/score. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind doesn't have the best soundtrack/score I have ever heard in my life, but the score makes the film all the more moving, while the soundtrack is well selected and appropriate.

I was also very taken with the story. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has one beautifully constructed story I can tell you, with an almost poignant message about it. It is strange and bizarre yes, but neither of those are bad, quite the contrary. Then there is the script which is both poignant and funny, not to mention very deep. The pacing very rarely feels boring if at all, and the direction is adept.

I have very little to complain about Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's performances either. As good as the supporting performances are especially from the always splendid Tom Wilkinson, I have to give the real kudos to the leads. Jim Carrey has done some good performances in some good films, The Mask, Liar Liar, The Cable Guy and Bruce Almighty showcase his comedy talents wonderfully, but this and The Truman Show show he is perfectly good at drama too. He is very understated here, but it works as he still manages to be likable all the same. The real star though is Kate Winslet. A beautiful and captivating actress, Winslet is absolutely perfect in her role.

Overall, wonderful film. Bizarre yes, but very tender and poignant helped by the exceptional performances and cinematography. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
38. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,9/10,most imaginative concept,"Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) falls for Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) from the first moment they meet on a train. After a bad breakup, Clementine erases Joel from her memories. He decides to do the same to her. Patrick (Elijah Wood), Stan (Mark Ruffalo), and Mary (Kirsten Dunst) are the three slacker technicians who are running Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson)'s machine. As his memories are eliminated, he starts to fall in love with Clementine all over again. He struggles to hold on to his memories before it's all gone.

The premise is amazing, but it's the imaginative visualization of the process that puts in on another level. Jim Carrey pours his heart into this very difficult disjointed performance. It's very effecting and probably one of his best non-impersonation performance. In its core, it's a beautiful love story. It's funny. It's poignant.

38. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,10/10,It's OK (very OK),"Very nicely crafted science fiction love story. More of an experience than a film.

What? Sci Fi? Well yes. A simple science fiction device, memory erasure, is the vehicle for this beautifully shot, brilliantly edited and directed love fable. The fact that this is a good film does not disqualify it from the sci fi genre. In fact, would-be sci fi writers and film-makers should take note of this.

But Eternal Sunshine is a love story first and last, in all respects. The characters are what John Irving would call ""L.A. dysfunctional"", although they don't live in L.A. Carrey and Winslet are deeply insecure people with little going for them but good looks (which they try to disguise), fairly sweet dispositions, and a desire for companionship. They meet on Valentine's Day in Montauk, where they have both seemingly traveled 'on a lark', and the entire experience of the film seems to derail from this point forward. Chronological, linear story-telling becomes impossible because the characters are having their memories erased in order to assuage the pain of their separation. No spoilers, so let me stop right there.

If I have made Eternal Sunshine seem like it might be too much of a challenge or too disturbing for an evening's light entertainment, be not afraid. Certainly there are occasional disturbing elements, and the characters themselves are all neurotic enough to have walked off the street and onto the screen. But the film is so artistically rendered, and so well thought-out that what could have been a nightmare really becomes a fantastic post-modern love fable. It's also one of those great films that becomes predictable after a while, but is so delightfully portrayed and satisfying that it does not matter.

The acting is exceptionally good. I would expect nothing else from this cast. Winslet is especially remarkable for her ability to play a young North East American better than most American actresses could. How this genius has been passed up in each of her 4 Oscar nominations to date is inexplicable. Carrey's talent is undeniable, though I dislike many of the films he chooses to take on. His performance here is easily as good as his award-worthy performances in the Truman Show, Bruce Almighty, and Man on the Moon.

We spend a lot of time inside people's heads in this film, yet the camera never becomes a member of the cast as it does in films like ""Being John Malkovich"". I can pay no higher compliment to the production team. This is a very difficult thing to accomplish, and it is done with flawless simplicity in Eternal Sunshine. This film has just joined Shakespeare in Love, Wild at Heart, and Brokeback Mountain among my favorite all-time love stories. This is the first Michel Gondry film I have seen. I am going to make sure it is not the last."
38. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,10/10,Best Film of 2004,"Joel (Jim Carrey) is a rather milquetoast man who meets up with free spirit Clementine (Kate Winslet), and they become romantically involved. However, they endure a messy breakup and Clementine goes to a business called Lacuna, Inc., where she has all of her memories of Joel erased. Not wanting to be left out, Joel also goes to have his memory erased. However, soon after it begins, Joel realizes that he wants to keep the memory of Clementine, so he tries to reverse the process.

Well, if you're familiar with Kaufman's work, then you know what your getting yourself into. This is just as weird if not weirder than his previous work, Being John Malkovich. I knew what I was getting myself into, but 90% of the movie I was saying to myself ""What the hell is going on?"", but in a good way. It opens with Joel calling in sick for work and going on a different train, heading for Montauk. He meets Clementine and they hit it off. Now this is about 15 minutes into the movie, then out of nowhere come the opening credit sequence. I will admit, I thought it would be different, but I'm glad that it is the way it is, the movie is 80% of the time in Joel's head.

If you think you know Carrey, think again. This movie is his best performance, better than Majestic, Truman show and all of his comedic roles (which is what I love him for). Just looking at his face from the second we see him, we feel his pain, then like that, we feel his joy, embarrassment and hate. Just awesome acting on his part, and Winslet was great as the free spirit who never seems satisfied. The supporting cast all work well in their small, yet important roles. Oscar nominations for Winslet and (crosses fingers) Carrey.

But if I were to bet any money on any Oscar nominations it would obviously be the writing, what a mess, but beautifully constructed. You think to yourself, is that scene really necessary? Then ten minutes later you think to yourself how brilliant it was, that's beautiful, crazy, give me whatever he's smoking kind of writing. Charlie Kaufman's writing is always clever, but this time he's one-upped himself by making something simultaneously bizarre and emotionally engaging. It seemed like his earlier movies were clever for the sake of cleverness, but 'Eternal Sunshine' manages to dazzle you with it's originality and it's poignancy. The fact that this movie was able to wrap such profound loss, emotional tenderness, and hope in such a self-consciously stylized package illustrates the incredible talent of the people behind it.

Michel Gondry's use of vibrant coloring and quick camera movement give the film a very involving first hand feeling. The constant use of the handy cam is very all involving for the viewer, and I suppose that this is exactly what is needed in such a personal movie. His work on the dream sequences is incredible as well. He decides to use more practical effects than what we see today with computers.

Eternal Sunshine is a tragic, yet beautiful film that sits at the top of my list of ""Best of 2004""."
38. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,9/10,The Moose Hole - Review of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,
38. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,9/10,I didn't get it the first time I watched it,"The first time I saw this movie I found it confusing, a little artsy for my taste and I didn't get it.

But I didn't come in here to give it a 1 point rating or a damning review just because I didn't get it. It would be kind of stupid to pass judgement on a film that I didn't fully understand.

Some years later I watched it for the second time. My ex had just left me, and I don't remember how and why I came by this movie again. But the second time I got it. And how life would be like a bleak dessert, frozen in time, in the eternal sunshine of a spotless mind.

And after watching it a second time I felt hopeful again.

38. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,9/10,Weird and wonderful.,"Joel and Clementine have reached breaking point in their relationship, every action, every word triggers the other, so much so, that they each undergo a procedure to remove all trave of the other.

How wonderful a thought, being able to remove all trace of an ex, better still having them remove all trace of you.

It has taken me years to get this film, years, I simply didn't get it, I'd tried several times over the years, it just never clicked, until now. If you're frustrated by the first twenty minutes, I urge you to give it another try.

We've all been there, hurt by a relationship, pushed to the point of despair, how wonderful it would be to remove all trace, it's a wonderful concept, but real life doesn't allow for that, however in film, anything is possible.

Wonderfully nightmarish, but sweet and tender at times too, the moments of hate and loathing are eclipsed by Joel and Clem's tender scenes.

The only thing I can think of that had similar vibes, was Total Recall, dissimilar in most aspects, but that whole memory manipulation theme is similar.

I have forever been a fan of Jim Carrey, and I would regard this as one of his best performances, he's terrific, as is Kate Winslet, the pair combined so well.

How far are we from the manipulation of specific brain centers? We can already do a fair amount. The reality is that even if one can erase memories, we can't curtail the ""butterfly effect ""of our actions. We have trod the earth and the small or large changes we inspire, create something new. Now project love and romance, and, given time, let it percolate. You have Jim Carry and Kate Winslet being ""forced"" back together because despite their minds, they never left. And if the memories were inconsequential in the larger picture, their remnants will continue to influence. Pretty thought provoking. We are more than our memories--we are part of the entire picture.

40. Oldboy,10/10,A cinematic bad boy,
40. Oldboy,10/10,You Only Live Once...,"Imagine what you'd do, when you wake from a bad dream, to find you're held by four square walls, for as long as someone deems. No idea why you're trapped, what you've done, why you're kidnapped, just a ceaseless line of dumplings going down your gyoza hatch. Now some fifteen years have passed, every question has been asked, and you're suddenly set free, can start your own avenging spree. Before you do you need to feed, by eating something that's in need, so an octopus is ordered, and head first you cross the borders. But things aren't what they might seem, tied and tethered and undreamed, as the puppet master hovers, manipulates what you'll discover.

Some films you cannot watch too often and this is one of the greatest pieces of cinematic brilliance ever created.

40. Oldboy,10/10,Excellent in it's sickness,"I looked at program for today and I saw movie ""Oldboy"". I read plot and I liked it. What I expected is decent thriller from very good South Korean cinematography,something like ""Salinui chueok "". But once again I was wrong. ""Oldboy"" is masterpiece, so unusual from all other movies. I've seen lots of violence on screen and to me this isn't nothing new but I think that people under 18 really shouldn't watch this one. It's because movie is brutal and I don't think that younger ones would fully understand this one.

To say something about plot is quite impossible because I don't know where to begin. If I start talking about the movie I could tell few important things and I know that people often read other comments because they didn't watch that movie. So,I'm going to say only what I read before watching this movie.

On his daughter's birthday, Oh Dae-su gets drunk and soon he's arrested by the police. His best friend No Joo-hwan somehow manages to get him out of jail and when No Joo-hwan is making a phone call Oh Dae-su disappears. Someone kidnap's him and puts him into room during 15 long years.But one day he's released.

That's the plot. Very interesting, you should watch this movie and then judge it. By the rating on IMDb this movie is in top 250 movies. Now I can understand why. This plot that I wrote doesn't reveal the greatness of the people who wrote the script. I bow to them because this movie is so good, with all those twists and it really represents a whole new wave of making a movie, of writing a script and of acting in it. About direction and actors I can say only good things. Director Park Chan-wook won prize Grand Jury at Cannes. That's enough about direction part. About actors. I can say that I'm impressed by one actor:Choi Min-sik. He's amazing in major role and he showed great potential. I hope I will see him again in some good movie.

I cannot say anything more because I could reveal some secret and I don't wanna do that to all new viewers. Only a recommendation. Beautiful, intelligent masterpiece of movie that I highly recommend for everyone with strong stomach and too all of you who want to see one excellent, but sick story. 10/10"
40. Oldboy,10/10,If only we were all living in Asia....,"To start off; This is the one and only film that kept me quiet for a whole 5 mins after seeing it. I literally couldn't close my mouth, and yet there wasn't any sound coming out of it. Oldboy had such an impact on me that words are too little to describe that impact. Therefore this film is definitely in my top 3 films ever made. It belongs there because it has a massive ingredient that a lot of films seem to miss out on; a divine plot. Even though the acting and screenplay are world class, the plot is really the cherry on the cake.

When it comes to screenplay Park Chan-Wook is unique (at least for western standards) in his way of filming. The colours are so vivid and it seems like he wanted every shot to be a piece of art. One tip: If you like the shooting in 'Oldboy', have a look at 'Sympathy for Lady Vengeance', the third part in Park's revenge-trilogy. It's even superior to the camera-work in 'Oldboy'. Don't, however, expect a story like Oldboy's, because you would be very disappointed.

When it comes to acting and the music, this film is also one of the better films ever made. The music sticks in your head and every time I put in my Oldboy-DVD and the theme-song comes up, I'm just flooded with good memories (even though the plot doesn't have a single reason to be happy about). The characters are also presented very well by the outstanding cast. Especially Choi Min-Sik and Yu Ji-Tae set a very convincing performance.

I really appreciate this film being respected as it should be, by having a place in the top 250. If, however, it was up to me it would be even higher in the ranking. I don't see why films like 'The Usual Suspects' or 'Memento', which are fantastic pieces of film-making and which without a doubt deserve a place in the top 250, are higher in the top 250 than 'Oldboy'. They serve the same cause; a fantastic plot. But those plots can't stand in the shadow or even come close to the plot of 'Oldboy'. The one and only reason is that those two films are better known and from a western production company. If we were all living in Asia, no doubt 'Oldboy' would be in the top 20 of all time.

My advice to people who haven't watched this film yet: Go see it! This is definitely a must- see. If you have a weak stomach, pull yourself together and still watch it. Don't be as shallow as a lot of people here tend to be. Look beyond the violence and see the things I mentioned before: world class acting, cinematography, music and last but certainly not least the plot. Once you've opened yourself up you'll find a whole new world of cinema. Enjoy!"
40. Oldboy,9/10,Freaked me out,"I haven't written a comment on IMDb for about 3 years but was inspired to with this film. It is not very often that I come across a film by accident (World Movies on cable) and the spend the next day scouring the internet to find out information about it and can't get it out of my head! Anyway, yep there are plot holes, but Old boy borrows a lot from surrealism and you are meant to suspend your disbelief! I don't buy comments when people say ""it is so unrealistic because he should've done this ..."" because it is a surrealist film and meant to be unrealistic! For me the sign of a good film is if it sticks on your head! THis one surely does (althought I did have to look away a few times ... ) Loved it!!!! Work of cruel genius!!! (HOLLYWOOD - Please don't ruin it by remaking it!!!)

40. Oldboy,8/10,As good and disturbing as expected.,"I read the review for ""Oldboy"" a few years ago and have since read praise about the movie from IMDb posters. Often times movies with that kind of hype tend to fall short and is a major disappointment. I don't know anything about Korean cinema so I had fairly low expectations. I had expected it to be a simplistic revenge film, shot in bad film stock. Well I have to say that I'm glad I was wrong, and even gladder still that I actually watched this film.

The basic story is that a man named Oh Dae-Su is kidnapped and held captive for 18 years and then released. He has no idea who or why this is being done to him. While in captivity he readies himself for the day when he gets out and take revenge on those who imprisoned him, and to find out why he was imprisoned. So far it sounds just like any old revenge martial art flick and up to this point it pretty much is, but it's incredibly well crafted. I have to admit I have not paid much attention to Asian martial arts films since Bruce Lee died and maybe I should now. Mainly because this movie doesn't have the jumpy camera work, or bad editing of those old flicks. This movie is a crisply shot as any Scorcese film. That alone elevates this movie to a higher plateau.

Once he is released, Oh Dae-Su goes on a quest to find what happened to his family and to find the identity of those who had him captured. During the quest for the bad guys, the movie played out like an old fashioned detective movie. The search wasn't rushed and neither was it boring. I suppose the set up made us want to go on this quest with Oh Dae-Su which sounds like Odysseus, and just as Odysseus went on one incredible quest so did Oh Dae-Su.

It's when he finds the man who had him held captive that the movie truly departs from being an average revenge film to something that is extra ordinary and extraordinarily disturbing. It's at this point that I have to say that the less said the better. It's something totally out of the ordinary and something that I think will repulse some viewers, but at the same time one can't help have sympathy for all the characters even the man who ordered Oh's incarceration.

The acting in the movie is excellent. I had no idea that Korean cinema has such skillful actors. They all really played their part incredibly well. Min-sik Choi, who played Oh Dae-Su was incredible. He goes through the rigors of being a desperate captive, to being a determined man on a mission. Along the way he runs through the gamut of so much emotion and not once did he hit a false note.

Overall I have to say that this movie is incredibly well crafted and as good as everybody say, however I find it a little disturbing so I can't give this movie a ten. But don't let my not giving the film a ten scare you away it's a good, enjoyable film."
40. Oldboy,9/10,Great film!,"I feel compelled to defend this film from some quite frankly unwarranted criticism. Although it isn't without its flaws, and all films have a few,it certainly isn't a one star film.What this film has is the ability to be sublime, shocking, ridiculous, mildly amusing and visually stunning which is some feat for any film.The sheer scale of the comments here suggests that here is a film that gets to you in one way or another. This film is as far away from Maborosi as you can get yet both films are up there as great pieces of cinema. I wont divulge the plot or end this comment with a Latin quote to reinforce my self importance i'll just say go and watch it, preferably if you're not too squeamish and don't mind subtitles.This film left me thinking about it the following day which is normally a good thing (atleast it shows my memory is working!)

40. Oldboy,9/10,One of the best Korean movie I have ever seen,"I will start out by saying that Chan-wook Park is a film making genius, maybe Quentin Tarantino of Korea. The plot was original and the character development and cinematography was really well done. This is a revenge story that grips you from beginning to end, especially at the end. This movie is a must see, even if you have a weak stomach go watch it anyways, cause there will be those ""thats f***** up"" moments, the fight scenes are few but realistic. I am not going to ruin anything about this movie or give away the pot, all I can say is just watch the damn movie. Korean film making at it's best.

40. Oldboy,10/10,Absolutely authentic and 100% bad ass.,"The first time I saw ""Oldboy"" I watched it by myself on a rainy evening. When the credits rolled at the end I think I actually stood up and clapped. It's been a long time since I've seen something so original. The film is gripping, it grabs and never lets you go.

It starts out with a man who is locked inside this room and doesn't know why and blah blah blah...sounds almost cliché. Read the back of the DVD case for a summary. The last fifteen minutes of ""Oldboy"" are the most intense fifteen minutes I've seen in any movie. By the end, you are so eager to know what happened to this poor guy and why he has been punished. And the film takes a twist that makes every hair on your arms stand up and it remains satisfying. It's not one of those twists that leaves you scratching your head. It makes sense! A film like ""Oldboy"" is humbling in that it makes you realize that America is no longer turning out the most cutting-edge stuff. But it's also nice to know that someone out there still has the guts to do a film with no barriers that makes you stand up and flip off guys like Tarantino and go, 'that's what I'm talking about.'

10 out of 10, kids."
40. Oldboy,9/10,One step ahead of America,"Oldboy takes a hammer and ""batters"" its American equivalents, leaving them as pulped as a chewed up squid. Park Chan Wook displays what America misses with his ultra-stylish, ultra-violent thriller. Why watch Ben Affleck fail spectacularly to summon any displayable talent, when Min sik Choi serves up a memorable role as the disturbed, vengeful Dae Su Oh, in the second of the Vengeance trilogy. Park skillfully creates a compelling plot that will have you guessing through the entire film, up until the final shocking revelation. The Cinematography expertly done by Jeong-hun Jeong, who also worked on the follow up to this film, Chinjeolhan geumjassi. Everything about this film is done in style and panache and creates a memorable experience, and has many memorable scenes.

Many people accuse this film of being ""unrealistic"". These people forget that this a film, not a documentary. No one complains About Star Wars being unrealistic, and rightly so. Films have a right to stretch out reality, don't forget the reason it does this is to be entertaining.

Although the film has strong violence of a graphic nature, I advise you to watch it, if only to broaden your perspectives of world and Asian cinema."
40. Oldboy,9/10,One of most well-made films I've ever seen,"I decided to check this movie out after Ebert's 4 star rave review, and the cult status this movie has received (and was also intrigued by the sexy-looking Ultimate Edition), so I decided to rent it. I was VERY surprised at how different it was than I expected it to be - I expected a ton of violence and not much in the way of writing or acting. The first time I saw it, I wasn't blown away, just kind of like whatever.

When I watched it for the second time, however, I really started to notice how well it's made, in addition to liking it more. Every shot is bursting with background detail, a great amount of attention on the production design (the theme of a certain color in a scene was restrained, yet perfectly balanced). The actors really gave it all, especially the 2 male leads who really blew me away. The music is a varied mix of beautiful classical music and some pretty cool techno. The screenplay is brilliant; the characters are developed very well, extremely complex, and the plot is not only ingenious, but the payoff and twists are 1000x better than any Shamaylan movie.

Simply put, from a technical point of view, it's one of the best movies ever. From a critic's point of view, it is a very well-done movie that goes a little overboard in sex and violence, and is just a little strange."

I have just read a review that says the reviewer cannot understand the hype. I can see no hype. Everything the film promised and more was delivered. This is a truly wonderful film. It is beautifully acted, brutally and painstakingly directed and as good a display of raw emotion as I have witnessed in any language. The story is gripping, the characters believable and well rounded, the emotion human and the feeling I was left with at the end of the film is one of awe. And that was after I had watched it twice. Honestly, this is a truly, truly wonderful film. Do not miss it under any circumstances!

40. Oldboy,10/10,"Park Chan-Wook's Masterful ""Oldboy"" is a Tour-De-Force of storytelling! My favorite film of all time!","I just recently noticed that I have written 99 reviews on IMDb since joining in 2005. And I have decided, in honor of my 100th review, to tackle my favorite film- a Korean release from 2003, directed by the masterful Park Chan-Wook. I am speaking of course, of the controversial and amazingly elegant film ""Oldboy.""

Based loosely upon a Japanese Manga, Chan-Wook's ""Oldboy"" stars the amazing Choi Min-Sik as Oh Dae-Su, a drunk businessman in Korea. The film opens with his abduction from public, as he is mysteriously placed in a dark, dingy building, where criminals pay to have people held captive. Dae-Su is locked in the hotel-like room, being fed daily and only having a TV to keep him company, for 15 years. One day he learns on a news report that his wife was found murdered, and he later learns that his young daughter was sent to adoptive parents out of the country. Over time, he becomes depressed, angry, and eventually empty. He begins to train himself to fight, plotting to escape and seek vengeance. Then, all of the sudden, he awakens one day to find that he has been set free... given money, a suit and a cellphone. A taunting phone call from the one who ordered his captivity ensures that Dae-Su will stop at nothing to get his revenge.

He is joined by Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jeong), a beautiful and feisty young chef and his old friend No Joo-hwan (Ji Dae-Han), whom try to assist him as he solves the mysteries surround why he was imprisoned. He also does eventually encounter the man who ordered his capture- a wealthy businessman who lives in a towering skyscraper named Lee Woo-jin (played by Yoo Ji-tae), though the encounter only raises the stakes- Dae-su cannot kill him, for he will kill himself first to rob Dae-su of his revenge if he tries... And now, Dae-su only has five days to solve the mystery, or else Woo-jin will kill Mi-do, whom Dae-su has began to fall for.

The acting is superb, especially from our leads Choi Min-sik and Yoo Ji-tae. Both deliver astounding and detailed performances. Choi Min-sik is sympathetic yet at the same time frightening and unstable... you will root for him while fearing him. And Yoo Ji-tae is incredible as our villain, who is oddly likable and charming despite his cruel and often evil nature, much in the same way Hannibal Lector was in ""Silence of the Lambs"", and he plays the role with much joy and delight. Both were chilling.

Supporting roles were all well-played. Kang Hye-jeong and Ji Dae-han were both phenomenal, and all other secondary characters were well-played. (Particularly funny is Oh Dal-su as ""Mr. Park"", the nasty little jerk who runs the building where Dae-su was imprisoned. He's the sort of guy who would double-cross his mother for a nickle, and he's a lot of fun to watch.)

Park Chan-Wooks direction is what really, truly elevates this film to unknown bounds, though. Chan-Wook has a poetry and a distinctive, sharp visual sense to his camera-work. Everything is perfectly deliberate and perfectly fine-tuned. His choice of colors, textures and patterns also set a marvelous mood. This is one of those films where even if muted, the visual tell the story just as much as the dialog. Everything is perfectly planned out- right down to the wallpaper on the walls and the tiniest prop. (It's even in the making-of.) Chan-Wook's visual sensibility and ability to communicate his ideas with the actors is the closest to perfection as is obtainable. He is truly a master of film.

The script is very tight, dare I say, even flawless. It all fits together like an enormous jigsaw puzzle, and each piece is important. The few action sequences are amazing and gritty, the music is perfectly implemented to compliment the story. The many twists and turns the plot takes are breathtaking, and you will leave this film feeling touched and disturbed. It gets under your skin and infects you. You will not forget this movie!

This is truly an amazing film. I usually try to find something negative to mention in each of my reviews, but here... I just can't.

""Oldboy"" is a 10 out of 10. It is as close to perfection as a film can get."
40. Oldboy,4/10,Violence without sense,
40. Oldboy,10/10,Absolutely superb,"I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a film as much as this one.

The key premise is original, which is rare enough by itself, and when you add to that some good writing you get a great film.

There are some deliberately hammed up comic moments to lighten the mostly very dark mood of the film and these are genuinely very funny.

The action is often over the top, but not in a gory way, and it is interesting to watch the story unfold with the viewer having no more idea of what is happening and why than the protagonist.

The pace is quick enough that you never get bored and the ending is dark and nasty and twisted and surprising.

There is nothing bad I can say about the film."
41. Apocalypse Now,9/10,"War, What is it Good For...","Colonel Kurtz has disappeared within the jungle, with his troupe of fighting fiends ready to rumble, you've been tasked to take him out, but first you have to search and scout, along a river where the residents are disgruntled (to put it mildly). Lots of bloodshed, bullets, ballistics, then flow, there's napalm too that conjures up impressive glow, many lives are lost and taken, in this hell where you're forsaken, but don't ask why, because nobody really knows.

Still a spectacular piece of filmmaking that demonstrates on many levels the destruction, physical and mental that armed conflict causes, and yet we perpetually fail to learn from past events.

41. Apocalypse Now,10/10,This Is the End...,
41. Apocalypse Now,10/10,My All Time Favourite Movie,"I first saw APOCALYPSE NOW in 1985 when it was broadcast on British television for the first time . I was shell shocked after seeing this masterpiece and despite some close competition from the likes of FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING this movie still remains my all time favourite nearly 20 years after I first saw it

This leads to the problem of how I can even begin to comment on the movie . I could praise the technical aspects especially the sound , editing and cinematography but everyone else seems to have praised ( Rightly too ) these achievements to high heaven while the performances in general and Robert Duvall in particular have also been noted , and everyone else has mentioned the stark imagery of the Dou Long bridge and the montage of the boat traveling upriver after passing through the border

How about the script ? Francis Ford Coppola is best known as a director but he's everyway a genius as a screenwriter as he was as a director , I said "" was "" in the past tense because making this movie seems to have burned out every creative brain cell in his head , but his sacrifice was worth it . In John Milius original solo draft we have a script that's just as insane and disturbing as the one on screen , but Coppola's involvement in the screenplay has injected a narrative that exactly mirrors that of war . Check how the screenplay starts off all jingoistic and macho with a star turn by Bill Kilgore who wouldn't have looked out of place in THE GREEN BERETS but the more the story progresses the more shocking and insane everything becomes , so much so that by the time reaches Kurtz outpost the audience are watching another film in much the same way as the characters have sailed into another dimension . When Coppola states "" This movie isn't about Vietnam - It is Vietnam "" he's right . What started off as a patriotic war to defeat communist aggression in the mid 1960s had by the film's setting ( The Manson trial suggests it's 1970 ) had changed America's view of both the world and itself and of the world's view of America

It's the insane beauty of APOCALYPSE NOW that makes it a masterwork of cinema and says more in its running time about the brutality of conflict and the hypocrisy of politicians ( What did you do in the Vietnam War Mr President ? ) than Michael Moore could hope to say in a lifetime . I've not seen the REDUX version but watching the original print I didn't feel there was anything missing from the story which like all truly great films is very basic . In fact the premise can lend itself to many other genres like a western where an army officer has to track down and kill a renegade colonel who's leading an injun war party , or a sci-fi movie where a UN assassin is to eliminate a fellow UN soldier who's leading a resistance movement on Mars , though this is probably down to Joseph Conrad's original source novel

My all time favourite movie and it's very fitting that I chose this movie to be my one thousandth review at the IMDb"
41. Apocalypse Now,10/10,The most anti-war pro-war film ever made.,
41. Apocalypse Now,10/10,A Surreal Journey Into Darkness,"Apocalypse Now is an interesting film, not because it is supposedly an anti-war film, but because it is surreal and shows an interesting journey into madness.

Martin Sheen gives us an insight into his character here and we see the senselessness of the whole situation and how easy it is to lose yourself in certain situations.

We follow his journey and the various events that befall him and a small group of soldiers in a patrol boat traveling deep into the jungle. On their way, really bizarre things happen.

Along the way, we also see Robert Duvall in the role of a completely insane officer, whose episodic role has a profound impact on the film.

The film should essentially be anti-war, but it didn't strike me as such, but simply as a film about the fate of various people who found themselves in unusual situations.

Their whole mission doesn't really make sense, and in the end they accomplished nothing, but that's the point. Everything was really in vain.

The direction is excellent, the music is perfectly integrated into the film and matches the tone of the film.

For me, this is a film about the loss of reason and the journey to madness. If civilization completely collapses, and somewhere it has already collapsed a long time ago, this is roughly what we can expect, madness and insanity.

I watched three versions of the film and I liked the Redux version the best.

An interesting and brutal journey into madness and darkness."
41. Apocalypse Now,9/10,Coppola conveyed the drama and spectacle of this truly outstanding film,"After the success of the first two 'Godfather' films in 1972 and 1974 respectively, Francis Ford Coppola embarked on an ambitious attempt to bring home the reality of the war in Vietnam, which had concluded with the fall of Saigon to the Vietcong in 1975 The plot was loosely based on the book 'Heart of Darkness,' a story by Joseph Conrad about Kurtz, a trading company agent in the African jungle who has acquired mysterious powers over the nativesCoppola retains much of this, including such details as the severed heads outside Kurtz's headquarters and his final words, ""The horror the horror""

In the film, Sheen plays an army captain given the mission to penetrate into Cambodia, and eliminate, with ""extreme prejudice,"" a decorated officer who has become an embarrassment to the authorities On his journey up the river to the renegade's camp he experiences the demoralization of the US forces, high on dope or drunk with power

Although, as a result of cuts forced on Coppola, the film was accused of incoherence when first released, it was by the most serious attempt to get to grips with the experience of Vietnam and a victorious reinvention of the war film genre In 1980 the film won an Oscar for Best Cinematography and Best Sound

""Apocalypse Now"" was re-released in 2001 with fifty minutes restored As a result, the motion picture can now be seen as the epic masterpiece it is"
41. Apocalypse Now,9/10,Take the long ride to perdition.,"There are films we watch because they are good, even though they are painful for us. This is a film I saw one time. At that time I thought to myself, this is enough. It was painful to make that journey down the river, wondering what was around every corner. Then we meet the products of our own id impulses, as we are the enemy, our souls have been brought down to this. At the end of the river is the man who came before us, and we see the uselessness of the journey. It is the Heart of Darkness. There are death masters like Robert Duvall. There are those who can only hope to survive, but the war is the master. The Doors music as the napalm settles gently on the treetops and across the ground, sweeps us up gently. Meanwhile it is consuming the flesh of the Vietnamese people, as well as an occasional American soldier. The ancient Romans could not envision peace without war. We and much of the world seem to have embraced those tenets put forth some two thousand years ago. This film gets into the marrow.

41. Apocalypse Now,7/10,Crumbles under its own weight,"I have nothing but respect for Francis Ford Coppola. He is deservedly one of the greatest directors of all time and his style of film-making is pretty much inimitable. Yet I can't really say I enjoyed this movie. At least not the Redux version I saw.

First the good parts. It's a damn beautiful film. The mood, as they slowly drift up the Vietnamese river, keeps building and building and you can smell the heat and wetness in the air, feel the sweat dripping down your back, hear the hollow echoing screaming around you. The script was heavily inspired by the classic novella Heart of Darkness and that's exactly the mood and atmosphere they achieved.

The acting is also topnotch, with one glaring exception, and I've never seen Charlie Sheen do a more convincing role than here. You can almost see the cracks in their souls as the heaviness of the war settles around them as they are pulled from combat and send to face almost certain deaths as they hunt their elusive quarry.

It's a well-made film. Everything from camera-work to sets to directing works, and works so well, but the fact remains that's it's just too long. At least the Redux version. You can only stretch the atmosphere and suspense for so long until you start to look at the clock. That's partly the purpose and to this film's credit, any other film would have crumbled way sooner, but crumble it does, eventually.

I also have problems with Marlon Brando's performance. Apparently the man showed up hugely overweight, completely unprepared and pretty much being as unprofessional as you can be. And it shows. The final third of the film throws the suspense straight out of the window and pretty much the only question left is ""Brando, what happened, man?""

I can see why people love this film. It's a haunting take on war, has amazing atmosphere, vivid imagery, memorable characters and as a whole there are very few movies like it. Personally I lost interest after the halfway point, but that's just me."
41. Apocalypse Now,10/10,In my top five favorite films ever made,"Apocalypse Now is not only my personal favorite work by Francis Ford Coppolla, it's also one of the great visions ever put onto cinema. It makes what was horrific, strange, and ironically exciting and mysterious about the Vietnam War into this mad tale of obsession, death, loss, and the dark side of humanity. While the stories behind the production of the film made it notorious and rather risky back in 1979, it works on its own terms and represents not just Coppola's genius but others in the Zoetrope team as well. It also paints a sometimes lurid, ultra-violent, bleak and curious view of what war does to people, both in the lower ranks, the big-guns, and those who go too far ""up the river"".

Many have also been perplexed by Marlon Brando's performance in the film, but it's actually one of his very best turns on screen, albeit improvised and close to running off the rails. His few moments on screen (even in the somewhat unnecessary scene plopped into the Redux version) there's enough conviction in what he's saying- and what perhaps isn't said- that makes the trip down the river worthwhile on an intellectual and poetic level. And making up the bulk of the film are delirious turns by Robert Duvall (a Oscar nominated turn he should've won), Martin Sheen as the Captain with almost too much to ponder in an ever increasing state of everything but him being insane; character actors like Sam Bottoms, Frederic Forrest and 14 year-old Laurence Fishburne have some of the best work they've ever done. And it goes without saying that Dennis Hopper comes close to stealing any scene he's in, for better or worse, with the most to say in rambling, yet coherent words.

Every time I watch this film (and mostly the original version which is what first drew me in completely as opposed to the very good if muddled Redux version) I am astounded with how operatic everything is, and how the variations on the madness and chaos of Vietnam is put together. Of course one can give adulation to Coppola for this as he completed it without totally going off the deep end or possibly dying, and his talents are pulled to their richest peaks here as a storyteller and director of actors. But it can't be said enough how much I can't get enough of Vittorio Storaro's cinematography, which has in part come close to perfect for this kind of epic film. The music is perfectly eerie and insidious, with the Doors song used for one of my favorite iconic scenes in the movies (both of them). Walter Murch's editing- which apparently was what saved the film from being a four-hour disaster- makes the action move when it needs to and for individual shots to get their due. And even the production design is remarkable and, to the extent it goes to, original in its partial translation of both Conrad's fiction and the unfortunate realities of life on the river.

If you haven't seen it yet, in short, get off your ass and get a copy; it might cause a kind of shell-shock for a viewer after first taking it all in, but it has some of the purest, most rewarding bits of cinema ever to come out of that all-too-brief American new-wave of the 1970's."
41. Apocalypse Now,10/10,"In my opinion, Coppola's best work","My favourite movie of all time. This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary 'Heart of Darkness' made it even more compelling. Coppola at this point was king of Hollywood after making 'the Godfather' and 'GodfatherII' and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like 'Apocalypse Now'. Through sheer arrogance he went to the Phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there. Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he got to Col. Kurtz's compound. And just like Willard, he DIDN'T know what he was going to do once he got there. This is such a masterpiece of American cinema, beautifully photographed and the river is such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story. What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it offers no answers or conclusions. Consequently, because of this open-endedness, it infuriates some viewers who like their movies to be much more obvious.

This movie defies categorization. Some call it a war movie which it isn't at all, really it is more of a personal study of man. The best pic about Vietnam is 'Platoon' in my opinion and if a viewer is seeking a retelling of the Vietnam War go there first for answers.

Coppola should be commended for his take on the bureaucracy of war which he conveys quite effectively with the meeting with Gen.Corman and Lucas (Harrison Ford) and the Playmate review. The sheer audacity of Kilgore makes him an unforgettable character and the dawn attack will always be a Hollywood classic.

It is an almost psychedelic cruise to a very surreal ending which makes it a movie not accessible to everyone. Very challenging to watch but rewarding as well. I could offer my explanations on each scene but that would be totally pointless. This movie is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to immediate gratification.

A little footnote, definitely if your a first-time viewer of Apocalypse Now, watch the original version first, the 'Redux' version is, I think, more intended for the hardcore fan and is more of a curiosity than a 'new and improved' version of the movie"
41. Apocalypse Now,8/10,The horror. The horror,
41. Apocalypse Now,5/10,The REDUX version,"'This is the end' sings Jim Morrison as choppers criss-cross the screen. No, Jim, it's just the beginning. The beginning of a 202-minute, drug-fuelled Vietnam war epic that follows a group of US soldiers upriver, deep into enemy territory, where they witness madness, come to realise the futility of their conflict, and are reminded of the heart of darkness that beats in all men. And like their mission, it's extremely hard going at times.

Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this wild '70s classic starts off brilliantly, with war weary Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) being sent on a covert mission to assassinate renegade Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), whose behaviour and methods are proving an embarrassment to the US army. An early set-piece—an air attack on a Vietcong village to the strains of Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries—is hugely impressive, boding well for the rest of the film. The genius continues with Robert Duvall's unforgettable performance as bonkers Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore, while a jungle encounter with a tiger, and a visit by some Playboy playmates to boost moral only add to the fun.

Unfortunately, once the group of soldiers arrive at a French plantation, Apocalypse Now Redux becomes as bloated and unintelligible as its out-of-shape, mumbling star Brando: the action slows down to a snail's pace, and the vast amount of narcotics consumed by cast and crew becomes more than evident, the film turning into a dull psychedelic haze of drug-fuelled weirdness. Dennis Hopper, as a crazed photo journalist, is particularly spaced out, acting like he's single-handedly snorted the entire cocaine supply of the Philippines. This half of the film, as Hopper might say, is a real drag, man.

If I ever decide to watch Apocalypse Now again, which I think is unlikely, I'll be sure to watch the original theatrical version. Many think it is better; even if that isn't the case, it's definitely shorter.

7.5/10 for everything that happens before the plantation scene; 2.5/10 for the rest. So that's an average of 5/10."
41. Apocalypse Now,5/10,Just doesn't engage me,"I honestly don't find it all that interesting. Yes, it has some interesting, even spectacular images, but for me, it has no engaging story or characters. I simply didn't care what happened to Willard, Kurtz, or anyone else. Everything I've heard says it's not a realistic depiction of Vietnam, including the famous helicopter attack. The sound is good, but the cinematography is somewhat overrated. It's not even a large format film. I get that this film is supposed to be Big Important Cinema, and I'm certainly not one of those people who sneers at the likes of Citizen Kane or 2001 (I think highly of both of those films), but this one? Meh.

This is a vision of nightmare that I could never forget. More than any other movie, there are scenes here that are seared into my memory. Rarely do I give 10/10. This is one movie where I gave a 10 without reservations. There are more iconic, original and impressive scenes here than any modern movie. There is no CGI, just real movie making. Director Francis Ford Coppola used his reputation after the two Godfather movies, and risked it all for this movie. You can tell he left it all on the screen.

41. Apocalypse Now,10/10,One of the greatest films ever made,"The original ""Apocalypse Now"" is an awe-inspiring masterpiece and is my all-time favorite film. Memorable scenes abound, starting with the mind-blowing opening with Willard (Martin Sheen) having a mental breakdown in his sweltering Saigon hotel room to the tune of The Doors' ""The End.""

Speaking of Sheen, people overlook the fact that he expertly carries the film. His haunting commentary is one of the most effective narrations in cinematic history and hooks the viewer into the nightmare-adventure.

I could go on and on about the noteworthy scenes, but I'll resist, except to comment on Col. Kurtz: Was he really insane or actually a bold genius? General Corman informs Willard: ""He's out there operating without any decent restraint, totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct. And he is still in the field commanding troops."" And, yet, Kurtz was accomplishing what the US military couldn't or wouldn't do because of political complications and niceties. I bring this up because, as I've aged, I've come to see that I'M Kurtz in some ways -- operating ""out there"" beyond the parameters and restrictions typically linked to my work.

The script was written by John Milius with alterations by Coppola as he shot the film whilst the narration was written by Michael Herr. The meaning of the story is obvious: The trip up the river led by Capt. Willard exposes him to two extreme viewpoints of war represented by the two colonels he encounters on his long journey, both of whose names start with 'K,' which is no accident:

Lt. COL. KILGORE (Duvall) is a romantic who embraces war as a lifestyle and even feeds off it, i.e. Glorifies it. The fact that he's a romantic can be observed in the air-raid on the village where he literally plays Wagner as a prologue. He feeds off the war to the extent that he ""loves the smell of napalm in the morning."" War is just another day to him so why not go surfing? Since he lives off of the war there's no way it can kill him or even give him a scratch. Kilgore naturally has the support of the top brass because he's part of the system and plays the game of war.

COL. KURTZ (Brando), by contrast, sees through this hypocrisy. He realizes that being in a state of war is humanity gone mad. It's living horror and therefore must be ended through the quickest means possible at whatever cost. He refuses to play the game of war as he expertly takes out double agents, etc. Of course the brass can't have this so they put out a hit on Kurtz via Willard. The existential Kurtz becomes increasingly disillusioned -- even crazy -- after jumping ship from the system and now has no sanctuary. Death is the only way out. His consolation is that Willard will tell his son the truth.

The ""Redux"" version was put together by Coppola and released in 2001 with the addition of 49 minutes of material that he originally cut, not to mention placing Clean's surfing scene later in the story.

Coppola made the right decisions with his original 1979 edit of the film (2 hours, 33 minutes) since the extra footage of ""Redux"" tends to drag the film down with 1 or 2 scenes being dubiously scripted, e.g. The theft of Kilgore's surf board. Not every idea that is birthed during the creative process is worthy of the final product and ""Redux"" illustrates this. Thus the new footage of ""Redux"" should've arguably been relegated to the ""deleted scenes"" section.

That said, I've warmed up to ""Redux"" and feel it's a worthy version of the film, but only if you've watched the Theatrical Cut and want more. ""Redux"" successfully fleshes out the characters and gives them more dimension, especially Willard and Kurtz. Plus the sequence involving Kurtz reading a couple of TIME magazine articles illustrates beyond any shadow of doubt that he wasn't insane and that the brass simply slandered him as crazy in order to justify the assassination of a decorated American officer.

Coppola's preferred cut of the film is the ""Final Cut,"" released in 2019, which runs a half hour longer than the Theatrical Cut. In other words, it trims the fat off of ""Redux."" There's also a ""First Assembly"" version, a bootleg, that runs 4 hours, 49 minutes.

The film was shot in the Philippines.

GRADE: A+"
41. Apocalypse Now,10/10,Apocalypse Now,"I have seen Apocalypse Now so many times over the decades, with various different cuts that Francis Coppola has released. I even once went over parts of the Grand Canyon on a helicopter with Wagner's The Ride of the Valkyries blaring out. It was like experiencing a moment of the movie.

Co written by John Milius, one of the most right wing guys in Hollywood. Apocalypse Now is not really anti war, it sat too much on the fence with the Vietnamese being cannon fodder. The Vietnam War had only ended a few years before the film started production. Major film studios were in no mood to be too overtly critical about the war. That will happen in the 1980s with Oliver Stone.

Coppola uses Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness as a metaphorical journey. A war that started off with good intentions by the Americans. Help the Vietnamese and save them from communism. You have Colonel Kilgore's (Robert Duvall) gung ho performance that involves Napalm and surfing. It then ends with Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) a once brilliant soldier literally gone mad.

Coppola said of the movie's production ""My film is not about Vietnam, it is Vietnam."" A typhoon had destroyed the film set in the Philippines. Martin Sheen was encouraged to get drunk for his opening scenes and promptly had a near fatal heart attack. An overweight Marlon Brando turned up on the film set without reading the script. It lead Coppola to shoot Brando with light and shadows to hide his girth.

Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) a Special Ops officer is sent on a secret mission into Cambodia to kill Colonel Kurtz who has gone rogue. He has set up his own military unit with a local tribe using savage methods.

Willard goes up river in a small navy patrol boat to Cambodia. A journey where they meet oddballs, a party of Playboy Playmates entertaining the troops, a trip to a French plantation (Special Editions), a journey that becomes increasingly dark, dangerous and nightmarish. Willard particularly does not care much for the crew of the patrol boat.

Apocalypse Now is an audacious dazzling epic that becomes a journey into madness. I dread to think how much of the Philippine jungle was firebombed during the making of the film. Coppola was at the height of his powers after his success with the two Godfather films. There is wonderful craftsmanship on display. Also wilful disregard for animal life with the slaughter of the water buffalo in the climax. Sorry Francis, your excuse about that scene is lame.

There are supporting roles from Harrison Ford playing Colonel George Lucas to Dennis Hopper playing a wacky journalist in Kurtz's compound. Even Scott Glen has a small non vocal appearance and Laurence Fishburne was only 14 years old when he played one of the crewmen of the patrol boat. The heart of the movie is Sheen. He looks young and innocent but is also suffering from his own traumas and cynicism before he embarks on his mission."
41. Apocalypse Now,10/10,Lives Up To Its Title,"From all of the Vietnam war movies this is probably the most frightening and disturbing and that is really saying a lot with so many spectacular ones that have come out. It has this freakish feel to it. Everything is so chaotic in the movie it scares you. It is not like it shows a lot of different things compared to the other Vietnam war movies. What does push to such a high level is the:

The directing was spectacular here. Francis Ford Coppola shows of his talent in his last epic movie. Unlike other directors he makes you feel as if you are in the war. Most others just display and show you the horrors of war. Coppola though makes you feel confused, shocked and scared. These feelings of war are usually told to us from a movie or story. This is something that I have only experienced very few times while watching a film. The writing was of course amazing too. It brought you write into the middle of the movie. It never made me bored and this movie is three hours. The cinematography goes hand in hand with the directing which very much added to the freakish experience of watching this film showing all the chaos around you even when everything seems calm.

The acting was bone-chilling. Just look at Marlon Brando also giving his last great performance playing a deluded, out of whack colonel. When ever I think of a crazy gone made soldier I think Marlon Brando in Apocalpyse Now. With Brando n this film you don't want to look into his eyes. Like the movie he was freakish. To me this performance is as memorable as the one he gave in The Godfather. Martin Sheen gave a very deep performance and probably the best one of his career making you see everything through his eyes all the craziness he is experiencing and yet wanting him to get to his goal. It is just a wonder why these two did not get Oscar nominations. Robert Duvall was able to show part of that craziness with his ludicrous battle strategies, among those playing music to tell the enemy he is coming. Also Duvall's character asking one of the soldiers to surf in the middle of a battle was just shocking but believable. Other great supporting performances were given by a young Laurence Fishburne, Sam Bottoms and Frederic Forest who all summed up the attitudes of many of the soldiers at that time without becoming a cliché. Also for once cameos were put into good use having Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford who I both love.

I would definitely recommend people to watch this movie. It has a message and everyone involved in the making of it is at their best. There is nothing more I could ask of this movie with its great acting, directing, writing, cinematography and great ending. Watch and you will see why it lives up to its title Apocalpyse Now."
41. Apocalypse Now,10/10,"Incredible Adaption of Conrad's ""The Heart of Darkness"" -- Possibly Coppola's Masterpiece","Movies seem to fall into two categories: films that reinforce existing societal values and beliefs, and those that challenge them. This film is a 180-degree shift from the idealistic rhetoric portrayed in offerings like ""The Longest Day"" and ""The Green Berets"" which seem more like Disney fantasies by comparison. The ""Apocalypse Now!"" project, the production and resulting film, is ""Heart of Darkness"" updated into a psychological horror story of the late 20th century post-modernist variety. The cast and crew who worked on it probably could relate to the terrifying places the human mind can achieve. This is the plight of Joseph Conrad's original character Kurtz who came into literary being in 1901 and subsequently referenced in TS Eliot's ""The Hollow Men"" (Mistah Kurtz, he dead) of 1925. Although neither a straight telling of Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" (1901) nor a first-hand account of the Vietnam experience, ""Apocalypse Now!"" stands as a masterpiece which pushed on the envelope of cinematic potential. ""Apocalypse"" is not just about the ""horrors"" of war per se, like ""Platoon"" and ""The Deer Hunter"", but the darker sensibilities of human nature as revealed through the raw and demeaning confrontations of violent conflict on a mass scale. Apocalypse Now! is not so much seen as experienced.

The bulk of the movie is the journey of a trained secret assassin, Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen in a tour-de-force performance), aboard a US military boat traversing an unnamed river into the heart of Vietnam and Cambodia where few westerners would ever tread. His mission is to terminate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a career army Special Forces Division officer who was the darling of the US Military until he went AWOL and renegade in the deep uncharted jungles between Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The official classified report is that the colonel has gone insane but as events play out, something else has happened to him that is far more terrifying than simply insanity. Sheen's mission is to terminate the colonel with the American public none the wiser.

The movie is rather episodic. The journey along the river is made up of several vignettes as Sheen and his crew meet different self-contained ""aspects"" of the war at the ground level. American audiences of the 1970's had probably never seen this kind of film-making before, with the possible exception of ""The Deer Hunter"" which was released in the previous year. The first, and one of the most notable, is an helicopter battalion led by Col Kilgore (Robert Duvall in an Oscar-nominated performance) who is a cross between General Robert E Lee and Richard Wagner. He loves to play ""Ride of the Valkyries"" from Wagner's ""The Ring"" when he bombards helpless villages. His line ""I love the smell of Napalm in the morning"" is one of those oft-quoted lines from the annals of cinema. Other encounters include an amphitheater where enlisted privates will be entertained by the likes of Hugh Heffner and Playboy bunnies.

Despite all the production catastrophes that impeded getting this footage into the can, the remarkable aspect of this film is its pacing. The original release (not the later Redux version) does a fine of job of building until the viewer is emotionally prepared to deal with the climactic confrontation between Willard and Kurtz. The strange discourse between Willard and Kurtz is worth the price of admission alone. And some of the shots of both Sheen and Brando in certain places are some of the starkest and terrifying images ever produced on film. Not even the likes of Clive Barker, Wes Craven or David Cronenberg have anything on Coppola in terms of horrific imagery. Brando's Kurtz in one scene in particular is so utterly terrifying it makes most other horror movies seem tame by comparison, which comes from the recognition that the horror is not from without but from within.

Without giving too much away, Coppola's solution to the climactic moment stands as one of the most innovative of cinematic revelations. According to the documentary ""Hearts of Darkness"", Coppola feared that the inevitable final scene would lapse into melodrama, and the atmosphere of the movie's darker hues would be compromised. He wasn't sure how he could make it work until his wife encouraged the director to witness the ceremonial sacrifice of an ox as practiced by the native people with whom Coppola was using as extras in the scenes with Kurtz at ""his"" village. After the viewing, Coppola had his ending, and it is one of the most simultaneously disturbing and beautiful sequences in the history of American film-making. Love it or hate it, no western viewer will be the same after seeing this scene.

This film is not for all tastes just as Conrad's original novel is not the kind of book that will be read on airplanes. It's not just the violence and the pointlessness of violence that are difficult for most American viewers to absorb. It's the naked unveiling of aspects of the human condition that seem so removed from suburban American life that make this film difficult for the average movie-goer to handle, which is as it should be. Coppola did not make a family picture. However, if the viewer can understand its larger point, there is a lot to be gotten out of Apocalypse Now!. If you're looking for a film experience to reaffirm pre-existing attitudes about American sensibility and heroism, better stick with John Wayne. But if you're willing to be taken into places you've never been, even beyond ""the evils of war"" rhetoric, ""Apocalypse Now"" will take you into a world you thought you'd never visited before, and the disturbing part of it is that you may recognize it."
42. The Green Mile,9/10,""" I knows you think I's a powerful man, but the darkness scares me boss ""","The world is teeming with wretched prisons wherein all manner of men are housed. Because these men are said to have committed a crime, the places are manifest and most men serving there, have earned their stay. However, as history has shown, there are innocent men incarcerated as well. Occasionally, one of these innocents are not only imprisoned, but are further remembered because their life becomes legend. In this case, the realization is nothing short of incredible as the new prisoner is a natural empath. Steven King the prolific American horror writer, chronicles this unusual story in a Louisanna prison where one Joe Coffee, (Michael Clarke Duncan) a huge, nay, enormous Black man, having been convicted of murder, is sentenced to be executed, by electrocution. Tom Hanks( And Dabbs Greer) plays Paul Edgecomb, an aging Prison Guard, who recalls his years in the state prison. Working on 'Death Row' or "" The Green Mile "", Mr. Edgecomb recalls Mr. Coffee's arrival and the strange events during his stay. With sympathetic Guards, like Brutus Howell (David Morse), Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper), Harry Terwilliger (Jeffery Demunn and one particular sadistic guard called Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison), Edgecomb recollects his discovery of the man's unusual healing powers and the surprising revelations concerning his innocence. The story is crafted by Steven King and it's application to the silver screen is perhaps one of the finest adaptation ever done. Duncan is magnificent and has a superb ability to allow the audience to learn his true purpose. Were it not for the sadistic behavior of Hutchison, who earned his ultimate reward, the story would not have carried it's genuine sympathetic awe which gave this movie it's Classic status. A great film and a must for true movie fans. ****"

42. The Green Mile,10/10,An incredible movie.,"Paul Edgecomb and his team of prison guards get a surprise when John Coffey walks through the door, a man of huge stature, with a timid demeanour, but a special gift, but convicted for murdering two children.

Is this one of the best ever adaptations from text to big screen ever made? I would argue so, twenty odd years on, and I am still captivated by the magic of The Green Mile.

Not many films get me, this one always does, it's an incredibly moving film, one of those films where you will need your hankies for a few scenes. Many scenes hit hard throughout, some moving, some disturbing, there really is a richness to its content that is quite something.

Plenty of outstanding scenes, I've always enjoyed that moment where the guards are first introduced to John, that scene towards the end though, (we all know which one,) that is such an incredibly powerful moment.

Tom Hanks gives an outstanding performance, as indeed do the whole cast.

The accompanying music works so well, the score enhances the film.

It's quite a long film, but it's one of those will just fly by, you'll be so engrossed you won't even notice the hours ticking by.

10/10."

that pure, love and honesty was portrayed so exquisitely well by Michael Clarke Duncan... it made me want to tear my hair out. If there is anything in this world which reminds me of true human love and compassion, it is this film. If you ever give up hope on humanity and the destruction which our disgusting race has brought to this world, watch ""The Green Mile"" Hopefully it will change your outlook a little bit like it just has mine.

11/10 SHOULD HAVE WON ALL THE AWARDS AVAILABLE THE YEAR OF IT'S RELEASE.

42. The Green Mile,10/10,A one of a kind classic,"This movie is a real gem. It is hard to find fault with it. Hanks is excellent in a role that clearly calls for him to suppress his natural slant toward humor. He is Paul Edgecomb; Tom Hanks is nowhere to be found. Yet he gives Edgecomb just the right flavor. One cannot find a single weak cast member! Michael Jeter should have got an Oscar. Michael Clark Duncan put just the right shading on his huge character to make him vulnerable and sympathetic.

Flawlessly shot on perfect period sets, the whole production binds together to bring the extraordinary story into the realm of a believable and compelling study of human injustice and charity.

42. The Green Mile,10/10,A rare gem of casting and direction.,"Frank Darabont returns to the directors chair with another adaptation of Stephen Kings novel. The events take place at a death row, the guards call the green mile. The story is a layered, rather character-driven fantasy tale of the events that transpire at ""the mile"" after the arrival of a giant man, John Coffey (Michael Duncan), convicted of the murder of two small girls. Actually this is not one single story, but several tied together seamlessly.

A character-driven movie requires a lot from the cast, and fortunately when it comes to cast, The Green Mile delivers. As the poster of the movie tells, this movie stars Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, senior prison guard of the mile, and as always he performs very well indeed. Yet the cast around him is even more spectacular, perhaps partially due to them being relatively unknown. With a face you know, one inevitably remembers previous performances, and the new role is coloured by this. Doug Hutchison as Percy Wetmore, a mean spirited prison guard was particularly impressive, yet his character could have been given more depth. The most captivating was the performance of Michael Duncan.

It is hard to find a flaw in this movie. The camerawork is superb, cast wonderful and direction flawless. The movie's considerable length, a bit over three hours, is something that had me worried. Yet the marvellous cast and the peaceful yet firm pace of the movie held my attention progressively through the three hours right to the touching culmination. Many will find this movie to be too long, but I for one was delighted of the style, combination of simplicity of events and depth of characters and conversation.

All in all the The Green Mile is a very touching drama, with the joys and sorrows of the life pictured with great skill, if not the best movie of the year. Five out of five."
42. The Green Mile,10/10,As wonderful as the book!,"""The Green Mile"" is one of my favorite Stephen King books and I have read it several times. I was anxiously anticipating the film version, but was concerned that the emotional impact of the book could not be replicated on screen. Fortunately this wonderful story was adapted by Frank Darabont, who did such a magnificent job bringing King's ""Shawshank Redemption"" to the screen. He does the same high quality work with ""The Green Mile"". The story is faithful to the book, only losing details that were not important to the story anyway. The casting is superb - every actor is perfectly suited for his role and does an excellent job, although I would like to single out Doug Hutchison. His portrayal of the detestable Percy is right on the mark and suggests complexities in this character I had not discovered in the book. The length is about three hours and it seems that critics are complaining about that. I can't understand the complaints. The film never drags and is never dull, and it certainly didn't feel three hours long. The length is needed to tell this story the way it should be told, and the story is so very engrossing. Best of all, Darabont and the actors bring so much emotion ot the screen, that I cried like a baby through several scenes. ""The Green Mile"" will haunt you."
42. The Green Mile,10/10,Mixing an emotional drama with a Miracle!,"As you may know, the movie is adapted from Stephen King's amazing novel.

The director Frank Darabont showed this novels are quite amazing for adaptations. This wasn't the first time he directed one of those adaptations. He proved that with The Shawshank Redemption.

The storyline is just too effective and great! Not only the storyline is good, the timeline order is the real key. If this movie was on chronological order, the movie would be half effective.

Also the great chosen cast with so iconic performances makes the movie even more effective. Especially the brilliant performance by Michael Clarke Duncan.

Cinematography is also quite amazing. I think we can see that in especially in the forest scenes and the rainy scene.

I think Original Scores could be better. It's good when you're watching the movie but the Scores are not meant for listening after the movie. The Prestige has the similiar scores in my opinion. Not the type of the Scores are similar but they're not that iconic to listen. At least it was like that for me."
42. The Green Mile,10/10,Rest in Peace Michael Clarke Duncan,"There's a reason why this Oscar winning tour de force is #67 ranked of all films on IMDb, despite the fact that it's 3 hours long and has some truly grisly scenes (not for the squeamish, children, or a first date.)

It's chock full of outstanding performances, not only from Hanks, but also from the many supporting characters, all who are rich and full. It will seem slow to the impatient, but will be richly rewarding for those with the stamina to make it to the end.

It will certainly get you thinking about capital punishment and perhaps different shades/degrees of evil. It is either a deeply moving spiritual tale or a wonderfully creepy journey down the rabbit hole of Stephen King's mind; take your pick. Either way, I put it right up there on my desert island list with the likes of Shawshank Redemption. It is definitely required watching.

42. The Green Mile,8/10,"Rest In Peace, Michael Clarke Duncan, you legend.","With this movie Tom Hanks proves why he is one of the all time best male actors that shook the world with their abnormal amazing acting roles. Among the TOP 100 IMDB rated movies, he has probably more than 4-5, including The Green Mile, Forest Gump and Saving Private Ryan, Captain Philips was also an amazing movie. But the spotlight in The Green Mile is reserved for Michael Clarke Duncan in the role of John Coffey. Nobody can count the amount of people that this person made cry in the early 2000's. He is the most adoring male human being that showed up on the movie screen in this century, his acting is out of this world and emotions are leaking out of every cell of his body. The fact that the actor died 7 years ago makes everyone 10 times more sad....rest in piece legend. Above all, we must not forget that this is another movie based on a Stephen King novel that succeded big time, which shows why we may consider King as the best novel writer of all time.

42. The Green Mile,10/10,Warning to Teamsters: Bring 5 Hankies,
42. The Green Mile,10/10,It will stay with you for a long time.,"The Shawshank Redemption is possibly my favorite movie ever. I had seen many movies before it, and I've certainly seen a lot after, but not many of them made me feel what that one did. Now, I have that feeling again. And once again, it comes from watching a Frank Darabont movie. I couldn't possibly explain the overload of emotions I experienced in the 3 hours it lasts. I have laughed. I have felt the emotions of every character. And most of all, I have cried. Very few movies have touched me like this one. Is there something to say about the acting that hasn't been said before? No, it isn't. You may have heard it is flawless, incredible, whatever. You did hear right, it absolutely is. I can't think of anyone in the whole movie that wasn't convincing in the least. The script has its funny moments, but it's incredibly deep, poignant and heartfelt. The characters are so ""human"" and unpretentious you can't help but adore them. But, well, there will be some you'd like to strangle. There has to be a villain everywhere, right? The Green Mile is a movie I will hardly forget. You can't possibly forget such an emotive story.

What, you want to watch it? Great! But don't forget to have grab some tissues first."
42. The Green Mile,10/10,"This movie blew me away, made me laugh, made me cry and me truly understand what the term 'sad' meant",
42. The Green Mile,10/10,Film was invented for creations like this.,"The Green Mile is a masterwork. This is film as art, at it's very best. The depth of the cast is extraordinary, with all of the players delivering excellent performances. There is a clear sense here that all involved in the production knew that this was something special, and gave it their all. See this film if you truly enjoy actors giving everything to their craft. Watch for the countless subtleties of expression, and the great power that the cast creates with silence. This is evident in the opening sequence and remains throughout. Above all, Michael Duncan as John Coffey is exceptional. He brings gripping emotion to a unique, fascinating character.

The Green Mile should bring you joy, laughter, and if you are like most in the theater this night, tears.

BRAVO!

42. The Green Mile,9/10,"Overlong, but haunting, thought-provoking, moving and engrossing","I am starting to like Stephen King's work more now, and I read the book. A wonderful book, that is faithfully(mostly) adapted into an equally wonderful film. My only complaint of The Green Mile is the length, I do think it is too long. However, The Green Mile is a film that is haunting, thought-provoking, moving and engrossing.

The film is beautifully directed by Frank Darabont(director of the slightly superior The Shawshank Redemption), is beautifully shot with a foreboding setting and atmospheric cinematography and lighting and has an engrossing and haunting story that is well-paced too. Thomas Newman's score is positively hypnotic and very beautiful, with some great authentic song choices, my favourite being Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams(And Dream Your Troubles Away).

The script is thoughtful too, and the movie also has a big emotional impact without feeling manipulative, I honestly couldn't help crying at the end of the movie. I have to say as well, the execution scenes were really quite harrowing. The performances are strong, Tom Hanks is excellent as the warden, as is Doug Hutchison who gives a credibility and complexity to a character that could have easily been clichéd and David Morse as Brutus. But Michael Clarke Duncan is the actor I want to give the real kudos to, he has a wonderful character and he absolutely nails it.

Overall, a very, very good movie. Had it been shorter, it would have been perfect. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
42. The Green Mile,9/10,Supernatural prison drama is a feather in the cap for all involved,
42. The Green Mile,10/10,Another period prison based Darabont masterpiece!,
42. The Green Mile,10/10,Amazing and captivating rendition of the novel.,"The length of the movie was perfect. It kept to the story to an amazing degree. The few changes didn't hurt the feeling nor the telling. The story itself is stirring and captivating. The casting of the parts and their portrayal were right on. This is one of the best movie versions of a Steven King novel I've ever seen, and I think I've seen them all. If you're prone to tears at a film, take extra tissues, you'll need them. The theater I was in was a mass of sniffles through the end credits. If you like fantasy/drama the film cannot be missed. There are some graphic scenes that may upset some, but this is Steven King. This is a movie I plan to add to my video collection as soon as the Letter Box version hits the shelves.

42. The Green Mile,10/10,Should be higher in top 250. One of those movies which makes you cry and admire creator's mind. True Masterpiece,"This movie goes beyond others into an elite group with movies like Facing The Giants, Good Will Hunting, Men Of Honor and others; in which the story is so brilliant and takes you to a climax higher than the usual, that it baffles you to think that there exist possibility in the human mind to create such a story. Kind of like songs, in which there are songs so brilliantly written that you can't imagine a human being writing it.

I love drama, they're my favorites and I don't get bored with them especially when it's interesting; so the length, which is something complained about by a lot of people with this movie, doesn't bother me at all it just adds more interest.

One of the best movies of all time and a must see!

10/10 without a doubt."
43. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,10/10,Fantastic...but possibly overwhelming.,
43. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,10/10,So Much More Than I Expected!,"So many have commented, so I will be brief. From an intriguing plot to wonderful characterizations using drop dead animation, this film works. About ten minutes into it it thought, ""This is just a kind of hip hop version of Spiderman."" But the main character is suddenly thrust into a world which he must learn quickly to manage. The canon takes a turn here toward incredible creativity. I avoid mainstream animation, but this has restored my faith.

43. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,9/10,How on God's green Earth did this work so well???,"The worlds of superhero movies and superhero comics are not as similar as they seem on the surface. Currently, film studios are all about the ""extended universe"", seeing how many different titles and characters they can shove into one franchise (Avengers, X-Men, Justice League), making for an easy way to squeeze a few extra bucks out of their lesser known properties. Comics have this as well, of course. However, they also have something modern movies haven't really tapped into yet: story one-offs, a chance for a storyteller to create a unique tale and not be constrained by the implications on or from the larger universe. Spider-Verse gets to do just that, while playfully taking on the fun (if convoluted) absurdity of extended superhero universes. Listen, I hear you. ""How could we possibly need another Spider-Man movie?"" Spider-Verse understands that question and has a take on it. Yes, Peter Parker is here. In fact, there are two Peter Parkers. There's also a Spider-Woman, a Noir Spider-Man, an anime Spider-Girl/Robot, and a Spider-Pig. At the center though is Miles Morales, an Afro-Hispanic Brooklyn teen who must help these other Spider-People get back to their own planes of existence. He fights with his cop dad, he adores his shady uncle, hates being simply the smartest kid in the room, and just wants to do something that matters. Being Spider-Man wasn't his idea, but hey, when a radioactive spider gives you powers, what choice do you have? Look, I don't have any sort of hot take on this movie. It looks great, the humor pops with surprises, the voice casting is beyond perfect. It's simply a stylishly exciting and refreshingly unique take on the superhero genre, and sometimes that's more than enough."

This film lives up to the hype and honestly surpassed my expectations. The only reason I think there are some negative reviews is because you can never please everyone. However, for the vast majority of viewers, I believe you'll find this film to be great. Highly recommend seeing it in theaters just for the amazing animation style.

43. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,10/10,Game Changer,"Have you ever sat through a film and you knew that films would never be the same going forward? For example, Terminator 2, Star Wars.. the first Toy Story... Iron Man

Well this is one of those. This is a almost rather perfect film. Let me just say the the stylished animation is just top notch. It as if the comic book leaped off the pages. I've seen practically all super hero films to include the DC animated ones. This feels as if they took comic books and Playstation animation and just came up with this perfect look.

And the story is great.. the pacing is so wonderful. It is able to tell the story.. and an origin without boring us to tears like Zack Snyder has done in the DC universe. The story is quiet touching. And it allows us to have a pretty interesting Spider Man in Miles WITHOUT thrashing or having a Peter Parker like experience.

Plus our the villains are so well done..

But I think we will see a lot more of this type of animation in the future from Sony. I think they announced their presence with authority.. like how Dreamworks did with Shrek.. and how Pixar did.

It's been awhile I seen something so unexpected and so cool."
43. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,10/10,the most visually stunning film I've ever seen,"There's hardly anything I would improve about this film. The visuals, concepts, soundtrack, characters, pace, humor and animation are all some of the best I've ever seen in any film; I was worried the hype would ruin it for me, as it always does, but not even the group of kids in the theater who wouldn't stop loudly talking could ruin it for me. It is visually engaging and beautiful in every scene, not to mention with an incredibly unique art style, and is honestly something other animated movies should have to look up to for a long time. The only real issue I can think of is the flashing lights, which really alienates any epileptic audience, but even then it's done so in a beautiful and artful way.

43. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,10/10,Captures Your Attention From The Get Go!,"What would you do if you could be a superhero? What if you have no choice? From the very beginning, Spider-Man: Into the Spicer-Verse is very energetic and captures your attention. This animated film has impressive visuals. The music creates a fantastic rhythm. And you just want to watch more.

The story follows a high school student named Miles Morales, who just changed school. He goes into an abandoned subway station with his uncle Erin and gets bitten by a radioactive spider. Ever since that day, Miles starts sticking to everything he touches. Then, he meets Spider-Man (Peter Parker), teams up with some friends from the same dimension and they attempt to save the world from the villain Kingoin.

The story is very original and makes the impossible possible. It takes all the abilities of Spider-Man to far and beyond with its action scenes. The film also shows a very real family atmosphere and the humor is smart. I love the non-traditional characters and how they embrace diversity. And yes! Spider-Man is Latino and surely does speak Spanish! There are also some fun new characters.

With this film, Marvel has created a film that celebrates comics, film and visual arts. Of course, it celebrates Spider-Man and makes this super hero relevant and contemporary. It is absolutely eye-poppingly beautiful and really pushes the boundaries of the genre with its colors, textures and camera movements. There are several different forms of animation in one film. You feel as if you are actually reading a comic book or the comic book is coming to life.

Naturally, the film does a very touching tribute to genius Stan Lee. I feel the filmmakers took some risks bringing new ideas to this iconic character which as been adored for over 50 years. The result is a must-see family movie that is even more appealing to new generations. I also love how this film is animated. It's so different. I've never seen a film like this one. I think it's very unique. Be sure to stay after the credits to see something very special, including another set of credits at the very end.

This film sets a new era in animated movies. I recommend it for ages 5 to 18, as well as adults. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and include it in my Oscar predictions as a very possible winner. This is the film parents will love their kids to watch and kids will enjoy in many different ways.

With great power comes great responsibility and we all can be heroes. This is the idea behind Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse - inclusion for all in the vast universe and the idea that we can all be heroes by making the right choices and doing our best helping each other in our everyday life.

43. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,10/10,"The better the art, the harder it is to find the right words to describe it.","Updated review 4-9-19

I've now watched this movie 10 times since getting it on digital and then Blu-ray and can safely say this is a rare, near perfect movie. This is of course my opinion and I understand why this movie isn't for everyone. Let's break down a few of the reasons why for each of these points.

If we had a list of everything that can be done to make a near perfect movie, this movie checks every box. The visuals have been talked about endlessly. It won an Oscar for them. We know they're great.

The story is great, giving us a new Spider-Man with his own skills and personality that he brings to the table. The script is tight and the production is executed with laser precision.

The voice acting is nothing short of top notch. This is easily the second best thing about this movie right behind the glorious visuals.

Shamiek Moore has quickly grown on me over the ten times I've watched this movie. His range is as good as any veteran actor and he injects so much life into Miles Morales. He IS Miles Morales.

Chris Pine did not phone in the short amount of lines he had whatsoever. Just superb casting because he and Jake Johnson sound pretty similar. And oh boy, Jake Johnson.

I never understood why JJ had gotten so wildly popular over the last several years. With this movie I finally understand. I get it. It clicked. From the moment he pops up in this movie around the 20 minute mark till the end, Jake turns in one of the voice acting performances perhaps of all time. He succeeds in bringing a past his prime Peter Parker to life and runs the gamut of dramatic, sincere, intense, but above all FUNNY. Every single comedic line never fails to make me laugh out loud. Many of the gags pop into my head while I'm working or doing something else and I'll chuckle and repeat the line to myself.

I've always enjoyed Hailee Steinfeld and she shines in this movie along with all the supporting cast.

The greatest thing about this movie also happens to be its weakness. For me, the visuals are second to none. Another review title summed it up perfectly. ""The most visually stunning movie I've ever seen"". Absolutely agree. And while it takes a little time - usually 10-15 minutes - for your eyes to adjust to the frame rate, some people apparently can not adjust to this. I can imagine how poor that viewing experience would be, too bad really. Another thing is since they didn't use actual motion blur, but instead chose to animate blur-like artifacts and tricks to make it seem like blur, or having images doubled and overlapped for a ghosting effect, it confuses some people into thinking they're seeing the 2 images of the 3D version without the glasses. And lastly, the sheer intensity of some of the rapid action sequences combined with visual aesthetic pushed just beyond the breaking point and then dialed ever so slightly back by the direction team, it's just simply too much for some people. I get that.

As far as continuity/plot holes and things of that nature, I think the movie could actually stand to be about 15-20 minutes longer. There really aren't many issues though so maybe this is just me being greedy for more visuals.

Original review: Sure, we can dissect and critique and praise using any number of words we choose, but in the end to actually appreciate truly great art, it simply must be experienced in the medium in which it was created. For this movie, it was lovingly crafted in 3D, and so in my opinion can only be fully realized by the viewer in 3D.

What is a comic book movie, and what makes it great? From the original Superman where we first saw a comic book hero fly, to Burton's dark and stylized Batman, to the graphic novel style Sin City, live action ensemble X-MEN, Spider-Man, Iron-Man, The Dark Knight, the entire MCU....all of these are comic book movies, and depending on your personal definition probably range from good to great. And they're all live action with varying degrees of special effects, and some with animation. If you had to pick ones that 'feel the most like a comic book', you'd probably pick Sin City for the overall look, and the phase 3 MCU films for a combination of visuals and capturing the tone and spirit of the comic book story arcs.

But they aren't literally animated comics. The closest to that would probably be the animated movies, right? Like Mask of the Phantasm or any number of the Marvel animated movies. But again those are really 'just cartoons', and I don't mean that in a bad way. They're simply cartoon versions of comic books.

Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse is quite literally an animated comic book, and yet it is so much more at the same time. It's an explosion of comic book ink and paper, a dizzying palette of superbly rich colors, a jaw dropping display of digital artistry melded with living, breathing characters we care about, a story that is perfectly derived from the very medium in which it is being created and yet not for one single moment ever feels forced or hollow, a soundtrack fused with an endless exploration of a massive city, staggeringly sized scientific chambers, gigantic forests, and neon-electric-digital-dreamscapes of action set pieces that whir and click and come to life exactly as they do in the minds of children reading them on paper.

This movie is breathtakingly good in every aspect. Like-I'm-questioning-my-sanity-is-it-really-as-good-as-I-think-it-is!?!? Yes. Yes yes yes.

Remember the old Sega game Comix Zone? And how it was like ""oh wow! It's a comic book come to life!""? This is like that, with modern technology, cranked up a thousand times.

But here's the most important part - *it was all done in the right way, by the right people, at the right time*. It feels like this project was greenlit and handed to the very people who created comic books themselves with a ""here ya go, you have full creative control. Oh and by the way you have an unlimited budget! And resources! Have as much fun making a great movie as you possibly can!""

My first job was working in a movie theater. I took full advantage of being able to see free movies. I've built a decent surround sound system with all the creature comforts and have a growing library of movies. From the re-release of the original Star Wars trilogy, to each of the prequels and to the ongoing trilogy today, T-2, Titanic, the original X-Men, Avatar, The Dark Knight, Avengers, Avengers: Infinity War and so many more...I've gone to many, many big movie theater events for the experience. And I can safely say hands down that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse in 3D is the best moviegoing experience I have ever had. It's that great."
43. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,9/10,A game changer.,"Even if you're not the biggest fan on Earth of animation, I'd urge you to give this film a try. It has such an incredibly broad appeal, it really does push the boundaries, and perhaps at the point in time that it was made, raise the bar on animation.

The story is great, and Shameik Moore does a cracking job as the central hero, but the deal success comes with the animation, it is quite remarkably good, with subsequent viewings you'll spot more and more, it was clearly a labour of love for the team behind it.

It is a dazzling, dizzying affair, there is so much happening on, but it's all cohesive, it's not one of those films that leaves you confused and bewildered, it really does come together nicely.

Plenty of action, plenty of surprises, I urge you to watch it, and then definitely get and see the mind-blowing follow up.

9/10."
43. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,10/10,Giving Infinity war a run for it's money,"This movie was absolutely incredible. From the animation, to the storytelling, to the characters this movie is completely one of a kind. It is easily the best looking animated movie of the year (no surprise there), but what really caught me off guard was the story they were able to tell in such a short amount of time. Each character has their own distinct personality and is given their own separate characterization without making the movie feel bloated. I knew I would end up liking this movie, but this movie has completely exceeded my expectations. If you enjoy superheros or animation you should 100% definitely watch it in a theater.

The characters are all great. Miles Morales is a fantastic protagonist; understandably scared at the prospect of being Spider-Man, but excited to learn. His relationship with his father and Peter Parker are some of the most emotiinal scenes in the movie. Gwen Stacy is also a great supporting character, as are thr rest of the spider people. The villains are fun and the action is jaw dropping. It's also tear jerking tribute to Stan Lee. This is the best Spider-Man movie by far.

43. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,10/10,What's better than one Spidey? Six Spideys of course!,"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse tells the story of Miles Morales(Shameik Moore). When Miles becomes the Spider-Man of his universe, he meets various versions of the wall-crawler from parallel universes. Now, all the Spideys must team up to put an end to a danger, that could alter reality in terrible ways.

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a mind-blowing film. Directors Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, Rodney Rothman & writer Phil Lord, have given us the best big screen adaptation of Spider-Man & that's saying something. I love the fact that this movie, makes us feel nostalgic about the previous big screen adaptations of Spider-Man. The animation is awe-inspiring. The comic book format of the animation is unique & is perfect for one of the most loved comic book characters. The 3D is amazing(watch this film on the biggest screen possible, preferably IMAX). The action set pieces, the humour & the emotional scenes are perfectly balanced, throughout. The voice-over work is unforgettable. Shameik Moore is spectacular as Miles Morales. Moore brings that much needed vulnerability to his character. Jake Johnson is outstanding as Peter B. Parker. Hailee Steinfeld is brilliant as Gwen Stacy. Mahershala Ali is perfect as Uncle Aaron. Brian Tyree Henry is excellent as Jefferson Davis. John Mulaney, Kimiko Glenn & Nicolas Cage are awesome as Spider-Ham, Peni Parker & Spider-Man Noir, respectively. Kathryn Hahn & Liev Schreiber are superb as Doc Ock & Wilson Fisk, respectively. Lily Tomlin, Luna Lauren Velez, Zoe Kravitz & Chris Pine are great as Aunt May, Rio Morales, Mary Jane & Peter Parker, respectively. Everything about Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is jaw-dropping! A must watch. Swing by your nearest multiplex, immediately!"

It met all of my expectations, and then went above and beyond them. The animation is a blend of CGI, stop animation, pop/comic book art and realism. The vibrant colors pop out at you, and the action sequences really enthrall. A very captivating and beautiful piece of art is this movie, and the writing choices leave nothing to be desired. The story is that of the traditional starting superhero with a bunch of twists thrown in. The movie itself actually follows past comics for the most part, with some minor changes here and there. A true Spider-Man, or comic book fan in general, will not have anything to criticize in this movie. Everything that fans want to see out of Spidey(s) is in this movie. There are multiple different variations of Spider-Man in the film, and all of them have their special moments to shine. The end credit scene just rockets this movie up past my already positive expectations, and it gets a 10/10 from me! The movie can be enjoyed by both young and old alike, and trust me, it will blow your mind! Best animated film of 2018, and one of the best superhero movies ever made.

43. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,9/10,The BEST depection of Spider-Man yet!,"This film was phenomenal for so many reasons. First and most importantly, it was the most visually impressive film I have seen to this day. The animation style alone had such a mystical and wonderous quality to it. The animators didn't stop there, however. They added so many little fun details that made me feel like I was watching some sort of blend between comic and movie. In addition to the gorgeous visual nature of Spider-Man, I was impressed by both the humor and the meta references. The reference to the cringey Spider-Man 3 scene and the post-credits meme reference were my personal favorites. There were tons of little details that I am sure I never truly appreciated because I have never been a consumer of comic books, but I have to imagine that this film is even more special to Marvel comic fans. The only gripe that I have with Spider-Man is that it failed to keep my attention in act 3. It was longer than it should have been, and it would have benefited greatly by cutting down 10 minutes. With that being said, this is the best movie I have seen in a few months and I hope that my review reaches someone who was not going to see it and urges them to reconsider."
43. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,7/10,"Too kid friendly, but good!","The movie is visually spectacular (with the exceptions of a handful of blurry scenes filled with blues and reds, maybe for 3D purposes?). The colours and character designs are gorgeous. The dynamics of the action and the camera work is superb. All of this is ""all time great"" level.

But... The story is ultra basic, therefore quite boring for about 45 impossibly predictable minutes. The jokes, while clever for a movie for kids, just didn't make me laugh. Not even one time. I'm not sure why. Also, the story lacks all kinds of depths. It's literally no sense, but I don't think is the focus of the movie, because...

What really works is the theme of the film. Everybody can ""wear the mask"". And they proved it by showing it, not depending on melodramatic and cliched monologues, but with the story itself, that included different versions of totally different people ""wearing the masks"".

The emotional bits also work well and kind of justify the boring preparation for it, developing Miles Morales origin story and his family and problems really well. Simple, but well done. For last, the villains and its plans are just almost pointless and beyond under developed. There was probably no enough time to give them better and more coherent plans. A good movie, visually superior with a well done and coherent message that actually works in the story (sometimes these superhero movies contradict themselves and they are about the ""problem with violence""... by using violence to solve the problem. No here. Spiderman is not white, black, female, old or young. It can be anybody. And they are good)."

44. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,10/10,An Epic in every sense of the word.,"Peter Jackson truly outdid himself when creating the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and he fails to disappoint us in the 2nd part of the Trilogy. The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.

This film is the biggest film in the trilogy. What do I mean by that? Well this film has so many things going like the amazing Battle of Helms Deep. Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom, to destroy the Ring. But the one who's leading them through the way is Gollum, he looks so creepy and realistic, that he doesn't feel disconnected from us. A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.

The Best part of the film, is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. The ending of the battle of Helm's Deep is quite breathtaking, and as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down Isengard, the destruction and the battle is so immense in size, that you truly have to see to believe.

In size and scale, Peter Jackson has truly redefined the word ""epic"" and he also pays attention to the small things that truly elevate this movie from great to amazing. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, but you really should watch the first movie to truly understand what's going on.

44. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,10/10,"Absolutely, totally fantastic!",
44. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,10/10,A standing ovation for all concerned.,"It seems ridiculous to want to add my own comments to a slew of others that are already in IMDB's records, but I feel like I cannot sleep nor cease the throbbing in my chest until I release some of what I have so recently seen.

Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings is one of the bravest projects ever attempted by a filmmaker. Mr Jackson deserves every ovation he will receive, every award, every bit of the praise and adoration that will be spoken and written.

This second installment of the story is a masterpiece in every sense, forget your prejudices about the books, they are another way of looking at this beautiful story (I know this is slightly against the rules, but a I cannot resist saying that a previous writers comment - a comment that compared the Lord of the Rings Films and Books to the difference between Romeo and Juliet in screenplay and ballet formats - was entirely accurate).

Gollum was an excellent amalgam, so easily could he have been an annoying Jar-Jar-Binks-Alike. Instead the way that Jackson and Serkis (and doubtless many many others) chose to portray the CGI incarnation of ""Smeagol"" was incredibly emotive and powerful. Gollum is profoundly disturbing, amusing, almost lovable... Not even John Ronald Reuel himself could induce that range of emotions for Smeagol in me...

A truly skin-crawling performance by a superb Brad Douris as the evil Grima Wormtongue was just beyond words. Douris _Became_ Wormtongue in a skillful fulfillment of what was already inspired casting.

Probably the most definitive casting of this film though was Manchester born Bernard Hill as Theoden, King of Rohan. The casting for ""The Two Towers"" makes one shake ones head and wonder, in retrospect, whether anyone else could have filled these roles. Mr Hill's performance was truly first rate, a performance which contributed greatly to ""The Battle of Helms Deep"", scenes which were a spinning tornado of emotions for the viewer.

Viggo Mortensen goes from strength to strength. His performance is visceral and yet sensitive. The overriding emotion that Tolkiens vision of Aragorn induced (at least for me) was awe at his heroics. Mortensen's portrayal in Jackson's frame brings new aspects to the Aragorn character. Mortensen's Aragorn is emotionally dextrous to go with his physical dexterity, he is sensitive, seemingly empathic, warmer and more fundamentally human, and yet super-human in presence and charisma. ""Definitive"" is not strong enough of a word.

If you still view Jackson's epic with scepticism I implore you to put down your preconceptions and your prejudices, but most of all put down the books... This is beautiful way to see middle earth, don't pass it up - The books are the ultimate fantasy epic - the pictures you draw in your head are better than anything you can imagine, but The Lord of the Rings ""The Two Towers"" is one wonderful interpretation of that epic story.

Go, Laugh, Cry, and Sit in Awe of this cinematic treat."
44. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,10/10,My personal favourite of the trilogy,"I do love all three films of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, all are visually stunning with wonderful music and strong narratives. The Two Towers is my personal favourite of the three for several reasons. For one thing it is less talky than Fellowship of the Ring, and the pace is a little more secure here. Also the final battle is just breathtaking in the action, direction and in its scope, and very compelling and epic. And some of the characters are developed more here than they were in Fellowship of the Ring primarily Frodo and Aragorn, who were played very well there but a little bland in comparison to here.

When it comes to the scope The Two Towers is possibly the biggest in the trilogy. The cinematography is one of the strongest assets, while the scenery, costumes, lighting and make up(the orcs look amazing) are all gorgeous. You can tell a lot of effort went into this and it showed. The music is also darker and perhaps more complex, the story is richer and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking. People may disagree, but I think The Two Towers is the best directed of the trilogy too.

The acting is very good. Elijah Wood is likable enough with a stronger-written character, while Sean Astin's bumbling persona suits Sam really well. Viggo Mortensson is as strong and charismatic as ever. Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee and Bernard Hill are also perfectly cast, but the real revelation in my view with this movie is Gollum. Here Gollum is designed superbly, and Andy Serkis's performance is absolutely phenomenal and Oscar-nod worthy.

In conclusion, a fine film and for me my personal favourite of the trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
44. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,10/10,One of The Best battle sequence.,
44. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,10/10,A magical film.,"Frodo and Sam continue with their dangerous journey, desperately trying to reach Mordor to destroy the ring, aided by Gollum, who is still conflicted about helping the hobbits.

Where do you even start to unpick and comment on a film such as The Two Towers?

Epic in every sense, this brilliant film will entertain and thrill you, astonish and move you. This one had me gripped from start to finish, I love the journey, but it's the ending that makes this film so incredible.

The battle scenes are astonishing, some of the visuals even now are jaw dropping, the assembled armies look phenomenal. It is pretty much non stop action, for a long film, your attention will be held.

The acting, as good as it gets, McKellen, Mortensen and Hill are all considered tremendous, and rightly so. I have to give credit to the magic of Christopher Lee, his very presence and delivery still give me chills, what an actor.

Andy Serkis, off the scale, every single Gollum scene was flawless, the voice and visuals are tremendous, what an interesting and successful realisation.

10/10."
44. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,10/10,My precious...,"Seriously, I never thought a movie could get better than the Fellowship of the Ring, but it did. This movie should be #1 on the IMDb top 250. This movie, as long as it was, captivated me from start to finish, and those who are not entertained by this movie can not be entertained period.

Yes, I have read the book. Any chapters cut out at the end of books III and IV will probably themselves in the next installment. If you haven't noticed, the beginning of the Two Towers was actually closed the Fellowship of the Ring on the big screen.

Gollum was a CG masterpiece. He added some light to this incredibly dark movie. At the same time, there are areas where you feel sorry for the poor guy, or just want to kill him. Smeagol was probably the most diverse character I've ever seen.

Elijah Wood put on a better performance than he did in the first movie, as did Sean Astin. Ian McKellen, who captivated us in the last movie, captivated us even more in this one. Viggo Mortensen, John Rhys-Davies, and Orlando Bloom made a great trio. They laughed together, cried together, prospered together, and suffered together. This trio gave life to Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas. Eowyn expressed her emotions clearly through Miranda Otto.

The music need not be discussed. Its greatness speaks for itself.

Favorite Scene: The Battle of Helms Deep. Possibly the greatest scene in the book, 50% of the trailer, and action packed climax to this beautiful movie.

The movie, like its predecessor, fails to bring us closure, but that's ok. Closure will come next year. I look forward to the Return of the King.

The Two Towers is now my favorite movie of all time.

The scale is broken. 10 is not a capacity sufficient enough to hold this movie... my movie... my... precious..."
44. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,10/10,Helm's Deep could be the greatest battle sequence of all time.,"As you know Tolkien did a great job with creating the world. Also did a perfect job with writing the battles. Also It's not that easy to fitting that to the adaptation. The whole cast did pretty perfect job with The Two Towers. I know whole Trilogy made in same time. Only the film editors are changing through the trilogy. So they managed a great job making these movies.

I think The Siege of Minas-Tirith sequence is also pretty good and flawless. But the horror and darkness is so effective in The Helm's Deep Battle. You may predict the Rohan People are going to win, they're the good guys after all. But even if you are watching this movie second time, you will feel that hopeless times again.

The first half of the movie feels slow, I think that brings realistic style to a fantasy movie. Of course there is too important scenes in the first half of the movie, I'm saying the most important scenes are in the second half of the movies. This goes for all three movies.

Tell me how can a movie achieve this much? Costume Design, Makeup, Art Direction & Set Decoration, Film Editing, VFX, SFX, Scores. The Trilogy manages to be revolutionary nearly all of that. At least it is Revolutionary in 5 of them. Some movies made me love some genres, The Lord of the Rings made me love the Cinema."
44. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,9/10,My Visit To The Cinema,
44. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,10/10,A True Fantasy Movie,"From the beginning to the very end, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is interesting and enjoyable. The books and the movies alike grasp one's attention as if they were real. You, the reader or viewer, can sense the pain of the characters, their emotions. The trilogy is truly powerful on screen. The second movie, however, I believe has something the first and third are missing; it feels like a bridge connecting two great islands. There is something unique about it that cannot easily be described. Metaphorically, the first movie is, say, a soldier. The third movie is the path home from war. And the second movie is the act of coming home because it contains the obstacles that must be passed through before achieving the goal. Although not 100% loyal to the written trilogy, the movies are done in such a way that the mainstream audience and LOTR fans from before the movies came out can say they were enjoyable and well made.

44. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,9/10,Magnificent epic,"The Fellowship of the Ring was a monumentally entertaining film, the Return of the King was an amazing wrap-up to the epic of our times, but the most dramatic moment for me came at the end of the Two Towers. After 3 hours of sweeping vistas, excellent Shakespearean acting, and otherworldly sights and sounds, we are treated to a scene that still sends chills down my back and rouses me like nothing since the final scene in Rocky. A lone rider (we all know who), set against the top of a hill, massing legions of horsemen behind him. He appears just as the heroes are losing all hope. Once he begins his descent down the hill with his army behind him, the camera begins a slow pan over the top and down with them, showing the size and scale of their forces. The evil army below looks up with surprise, a bright light fills the screen, the camera focuses on the lead rider (again, we all know who) who lets out a wrenching battle cry, the music swells to unbelievable heights, and I am swept away like I've never been before.

This is cinema at its very best."
44. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,10/10,"Jackson remains a genius, and this series remains a masterpiece--Faithful enough to Tolkein, and a fantastic movie!","I've read ---with care and delight--- the books four times in the last 34 years, including the recent reversion to Tolkein's ""original"" manuscript, edited by his son. I'm a fan. There, I said it, and I'm glad, I tell you!

This second installment of the trilogy is probably as good as a movie could get. It captures the Tolkein vibe probably as well as it could be captured in a theatrical release. Watching the flick tonight I realized that much of the vaunted charm of the very readable and very ""literary"" Tolkein books is in part the time it takes to read the long pages--- 1,000 to 1,400 pages, depending on the edition your are holding. And that time--- weeks and weeks of pouring over pages, re-reading certain passages, pondering and mulling over the fake languages and songs, and histories Tolkein concocted--- allows one to create and invent the Tolkein world inside oneself. That's GREAT! I loved each time I read the original. But no one could possibly expect a movie to give you, in 2-1/2 hours, that kind of luxurious lingering in the fantasy world. Duh!

Therefore, the movie's focus on action--- and FYI, it is dead-on accurate and faithful to the books--- is OK. The Ents' meeting in the forest took 3 or 4 DAYS in the book, and Merry and Pippin spent many more days hanging with Treebeard. The movie telescoped that down into a few hours. But hey!!! Think about it--- how could a movie, ANY movie, capture all of the sylvan reverie (including the Hobbits growing a couple of feet taller with the Entwash, etc.) in a trilogy movie series? All of that dreamy book-world stuff would be great to see on the screen--- but it would take dozens and dozens of hours of screen-time. Who could sit in a theater for that many weeks? There aren't that many ""festive"" people on the planet to make such a theatrical release profitable.

Maybe if we were wishing, we could have wished for a 30 or 40 hour TV mini-series. Then we COULD afford to meander and linger and all of that. Seriously--- I'd have enjoyed it. But then, the battles and evil empire and such would have to be portrayed with a vigor equal to Jackson's efforts, else the drama and peril (etc.) would be lost. For MY ridiculous wishing, then, I'm wishing for them to have made two projects--- the 3 theater-release movies, AND a 30-hour TV mini-series for all the ""literary"" vibe. But then, instead of a $300 million triology, we'd have had a $1 BILLION dollar (but memorable!) TV mini-series. Oh well--- if wishing were having...

Overall, ""LOTR Two Towers"" is an excellent movie! A ""10"" out of ""10""!!!"
44. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,9/10,Tough to put on film but came out very well,"Long before it came out, I knew The Two Towers would be the toughest of the three Lord of the Rings books to put on film. Not only is it the middle child, but the very structure of the book makes it hard to craft a linear story with all the plot lines in tact and interesting.

But I think Peter Jackson and company did a very good job. It's not as strong as Fellowship, but is still outstanding.

All the elements of the LOTR films are here: the beautiful photography, set designs, costumes, scenery, special effects. All amazing, all brilliant, all Oscar-worthy.

The performances are terrific, too. Bernard Hill, Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Miranda Otto, all did great jobs. The supporting actors, too.

It is sad that Ian McKellan's role is relegated to almost cameo status, but that's the nature of the book. The biggest shame is Christopher Lee. He has so little screen time in this film, I think he only says two or three lines on camera, the rest is ""brooding"". Such a waste, he is one of the great actors of our time, a real joy to watch (and a scene stealer to boot).

But the stars of the piece have to be Gollum and Treebeard and the Uruk army. The sequence with the Ents seeing the destruction Saruman wrought upon the trees brought tears to my eyes, and their revenge brought cheers to my voice. The battle of Helm's Deep was probably too long, but impressive nonetheless (and will probably be the model for ""epic battle sequences"" for years to come). And Gollum. What can be said about Gollum that hasn't already been said. We have entered into a new age of CGI, and, like all great works of art, it has a human soul.

A great film. 9 out of 10, the only items keeping it from getting a 10 are the short-shrifting of Christopher Lee and that some parts don't quite flow too well (a problem rooted in JRR Tolkien's novel, not the fault of the filmmakers)."
44. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,10/10,Fantasy greatness with one of the best sieges put on film,
44. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,10/10,The Two Towers! What Is It? The Answer Is: My Precious!,"The second part of The Lord of the Rings saga maintains the style, momentum and integrity that made the first film as brilliant as it is and thus what Peter Jackson gives us is one of the best sequels ever and certainly the best film of 2002. I prefer the first film for being closer to the book but I completely understand the changes made from book to film and I see why they are necessary to keep the film's narrative flowing instead of dropping dead. The film is not without a few weaknesses mainly because of it being a middle part linking The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King and therefore not having an obvious beginning or an end. This doesn't stop the film from being an experience that people shouldn't be cheated out of.

The acting is, like in the first film, very good and at times even brilliant. Viggo Mortensen improves greatly and provides a more well rounded and believable Aragorn and proves his qualities as an actor especially in the quit moments (of which there are too few in the theatrical release, this was remedied in the extended cut). Also Elijah Wood deepens his character considerably and shows many of the darker sides of his character in the film. This provides for some interesting exchanges between Wood and his faithful companion played by Sean Astin. Bernard Hill is introduced in this film along with the method actor, Brad Dourif. Both of the aforementioned are excellent in their respective parts even though there are some inconsistencies in Hill's character compared to the character from the book. These changes were obviously made for dramatic purposes and are very plausible. Ian McKellen's character, Gandalf, has been somewhat reduced in the second film but instead he steals every scene he is in. Likewise, Hugo Weaving's character has been reduced but he is still very good and keeps his character in the same style as in the first film. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies returns as well and I have to comment on the choice to make Gimli into comic relief, because while I understand the necessity given that Dominic Monaghan's and Billy Boyd's characters have taken a turn towards more serious characters there had to be someone to relieve the dramatic tension, I found it a shame that Gimli had been reduced to some bumbling clown. Fortunately most of his comic remarks worked. Among other characters introduced are Faramir, played by David Wenham, and Gollum, played beautifully by Andy Serkis. I'll get back to Faramir but for now I have to comment on Gollum. Gollum is quite simply the most interesting film character in the last decade and this relates both to the ground breaking special effects but also Serkis' performance, which was most unfairly not deemed fit for an Oscar nomination. Overall the acting is excellent like in the first film and all actors manages to develop their characters in ways that are at the very least acceptable.

The effects and fight scenes in this second film are among the best ever and is perhaps only bested by some of the effects in the third film in the series. The Gollum character and the battle for Helm's Deep seem to be excellent examples. Gollum is quite simply the most stunning and beautifully created CGI character of all time and he displays extraordinary emotional range. As previously stated The Battle for Helm's Deep is among the finest battle scenes ever created. Well paced and choreographed and above all the editing in between the hectic battle sequences and scared citizens provides for some emotional depth as well (something that was sorely needed in the battle sequences in Star Wars: Episode II). This gigantic battle isn't the only battle in the film. There are many other interesting battles but I'm not going to spoil them so you'll just have to see the film yourself. The battles are consistent with the style that was laid down in the first film they are simply on a much more epic scale.

Some people have raved that the changes made from book to film were too radical but I completely understand and condone the reasons which were obviously dramatic purposes. Especially David Wenham's character has been criticized and after watching it the first time I was a bit unhappy with his character as well but when you think about it the changes in the character were at the very least essential to maintain the narrative structure. There are other examples but it would really be pointless to mention them because the reason is exactly the same as in the case of David Wenham's character. Dramatic purposes.

Overall The Two Towers serves as an excellent link between the Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King and it deserves every bit of praise coming to it. One of the very best films of all time.

10/10 - On my top 10 of best films"
44. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,10/10,The Sequel That Dwarfs Its Predecessor...,
44. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,9/10,The battle for Middle Earth is about to begin...,"Peter Jackson himself has admitted The Two Towers was the hardest part of the trilogy to achieve, at least in terms of narrative structure since, unlike The Fellowship of the Ring, it has no proper beginning and no emotionally packed climax (Boromir's death in Fellowship was one of that film's most moving moments). It picks up exactly from where its predecessor ended: the Fellowship is split in three separate groups, all with their own problems to take care of:

Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their journey to Mordor in order to destroy the One Ring, and find an unexpected guide in that item's previous owner, vicious creature Gollum (Andy Serkis); Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) reunite with the reborn Gandalf (Ian Mckellen) to save the dying kingdom of Rohan from Saruman's (Christopher Lee) evil clutch; Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have a close encounter with the Ents, ancient creatures which have unfinished business with a certain bad wizard...

This second opus is less talking and more fighting: key characters are reduced to cameos (most notably Galadriel) and new people are quickly introduced so that we can be dragged into some huge battles, culminating in the 40-minute long combat at Helm's Deep, quite simply the movie's highlight. If, however, you want more insight on the characters and their motivations, get the extended cut, whose additional sequences are essential to understand pivotal moments of the third film.

Helm's Deep aside, the movie's most remarkable element is the mad, schizophrenic Gollum. He's got ""ambiguity"" and ""unreliability"" written all over him, as we see him struggle with his two personas, one the good fella he once was, the other a filthy, treacherous freak who wants nothing more than his ""preccciousssss"" back (the conversation between the two personalities is one of the most beautiful scenes ever made). He makes us suspicious about his most insignificant gesture, and has us thinking the worst may happen in The Return of the King.

Not as good as the previous part (at least the theatrical version, which I rate 9/10), but still a really good fantasy movie, and one of the best pictures of 2002."
44. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,10/10,The Greatest of the Three Rings,"Yes, it's true. Return of the King may have won more of the Oscars as the culmination of Peter Jackson's magnificent cinematic achievement, but history will in fact adjudge ""The Two Towers"" as the greatest of the three Rings. If Fellowship was a road movie and ROTK was a friendship film, then Two Towers is an unadulterated war movie of heroic proportions. Peter Jackson said he based it on ""Zulu""- and we can see why. It has a dramatic intensity and flow which none of the other films quite share. Good against evil are so sharply contrasted that you could cut your fingers on them. TTT also has the best score Howard Shore has produced. And it has the best dialogue.

The screenplay explains (with barely disguised contemporary resonance) what we are protecting in Western civilisation when we defend ourselves against those who would wish to destroy it. When Sam tells Frodo that there are ""some things worth fighting for"", when Merry tells Pippin that there ""won't be a Shire"" unless they do something about it, when King Theoden laments that ""the sun has gone down in the West"" this film could be entitled not the ""Two Towers"" but ""the Twin Towers"". It is Miltonic in its scope. It is cinema as art.

Yes, one may quibble about certain Entish details, and I know that the Elves weren't supposed to be at Helm's Deem, and that Faramir is a little undeveloped, but does this matter? Not at all. The Extended version is better than the original, but does not need to make such a quantum leap as Fellowship managed with its EE. However it will be a film that is seen as a landmark in cinema. A trilogy which may never be bettered. And a reminder of what we are all here for"
44. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,10/10,FilmCreature Reviews 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers',"You'd think you can't improve on a 10/10 movie, but this one does, with great action and characters. There isn't much else to say about the special effects that I didn't already in my first review, they're still fantastic. Peter Jackson doesn't treat this like a sequel, it's just the continuing story of heroes battling the forces of evil.

Frodo, now alone except for his buddy Sam (Sean Astin), is on his epic journey to Mount Mordor to destroy The One Ring. He'll encounter Gollum, a wretched creature who's definitely up to something.

And meanwhile Aragorn and friends are trying to protect the little country of Rohan from imminent destruction from the newly-bred Uruk-Hai, vicious monsters crossed with man and elf.

4/4. Wish I'd seen it in theaters."
44. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,10/10,If there was a spotlight for all time movie reviews it would be this trilogy-to-be-one film,"I have to say this film starting with the fellowship was incredibly well made. I know Titanic received 11 awards but I think this whole trilogy should receive 15. This intro to the trilogy was extremely in depth and even had the best prologue ever. I enjoy being introduced to the characters and thier origins and learning about the history of the one ring and how it does evil upon middle earth even after Sauron's death. Be patient with the action as is picks up as the trilogy's story unfolds. It all depends on what you see movies for. But this whole trilogy has quite a bit of everything. That alone surpasses all movies.

10/10 (actually more than that)

45. Aliens,10/10,One of the best films ever made.,"So often when you think of sequels you imagine cynical attempts to cash in on successful movies, efforts to bring in the coins with any old rubbish, when you think of the likes of Police Academy, Halloween and Jaws you can understand why, and then there is Aliens......

Not often is a follow up as good as the original (and better in some ways,) but Aliens is, I would class it as one of the best movies of all time, a cinematic Masterpiece which seems to improve with age. It's a space horror, which is dramatic, action packed and funny at times.

Aliens changed the genre, sci fi would never quite be the same again. This film will have you gripped, glued and on the edge of your seat, truly an adrenaline fuelled thrill ride, with amazing visuals, wonderful acting, and terrific music. Film makers of today watch and see how it should be done.

A masterpiece. 10/10"
45. Aliens,10/10,Excellent sequel--matches the brilliance of the first film,"Series note: It is strongly advised that you watch this film only after seeing Alien (1979). This is a direct continuation of that story.

57 years after the events of the first film, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is found and awakened from hyper sleep to discover that a terraforming colony has been set up on LV-426, the planet wherein she and her fellow crew of the mining cargo spaceship Nostromo first encountered the titular aliens. When Earth-based communications loses contact with LV-426, a band of marines are sent to investigate, taking Ripley and a representative from the company that financed the colony, Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) along for the ride.

For the difficult job of following up Ridley Scott's excellent Alien, director James Cameron decided to go a completely different route--to make a fast moving, slightly tongue-in-cheek, boisterous action extravaganza. Remarkably, he was able to do that while still maintaining a stylistic and literary continuity that melds Aliens seamlessly with the first film.

Ripley is much more fully developed in this film, although unfortunately, some of the most significant scenes were deleted from the theatrical release (if at all possible, watch the 2-hour and 37-minute director's cut instead). Cameron fashioned Aliens into a grand arc where Ripley's actions at the end of the film have much more meaning as she's not only fighting monsters, but also fighting to retain a semblance of something she lost due to her 57-year hyper sleep. As in the first film, she is still the most intelligent, courageous and resourceful member of the crew, but she has much more colorful company.

The marines accompanying Ripley back to LV-426 may be too cartoonish for some tastes (as for viewers of that opinion, most of the action and the film overall is likely to be too cartoonish), but for anyone more agreeable to that kind of caricatured exaggeration, it's a joy to watch. I'm a big fan of both Bill Paxton and Lance Henriksen, and both turn in wonderfully over-the-top performances, at their diametrically opposed ends of the emotional spectrum--Paxton as the spastic surfer/redneck and Henriksen as the intense, moody sage, with a surprising reality and an even more surprising conscience to go along with it. We also get a cigar-chomping Sergeant, a crazy, butch Private, and a complex, pensive Corporal as main characters, and a mysterious, bright young girl (played in a terrific performance by Carrie Henn). Much of the center section of the film hinges on the interrelationships of these characters, despite the action trappings going on around them.

Cameron carries over the crypt/labyrinth motif of the first film, and adds a metaphorical descent into the bowels of hell in the climax. The action throughout is suspenseful. Aliens contains one of my favorite ""cat fights"" in any film. It's also worth noting the influence this film may have had on Paul Verhoeven's Starship Troopers (1997)--although admittedly, we could say that Cameron was influenced a bit by the Robert A. Heinlein book, as well. Throughout all of the varied action sequences, as well as the important early scenes of colonists on LV-426, Cameron is able to clearly convey the logistics of very complex sets, so that viewers remain on the edges of their seats.

Part of what makes the monsters so effective is that we're not told too much about them. We only get glimpses into their physiology's, their behavioral patterns and their intelligence. Cameron gives us just enough to become wrapped up in the film, but not so much that we become overly familiar with the aliens, or start to question the logic behind the film. He also smartly carries over some devices from the first film that were abandoned to an extent, such as the acidic blood of the aliens, and he supplies answers to the few questions that the first film raised, such as why the blood doesn't corrode instruments and objects when a dead alien is examined.

Aliens is yet another example of a sequel that is just as good as an original film in a series. Just make sure you watch both in order, and try to watch the director's cuts."
45. Aliens,10/10,A masterpiece - one of the best epic-action films of all time my personal favorite,
45. Aliens,10/10,James Cameron and Bill Paxton at their finest,"There are really good movies and then there's that select few that change your life. For me movies like Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, JFK, Titanic and Star Wars did that. By viewing a movie you see life in a different light. Aliens also did that to me. I didn't think a movie could scare me as much as Halloween did but this one certainly did that and more. The atmosphere in this movie, and the lighting and cinematography and of course the direction are top notch, and some of the scenes are some of the scariest I've seen in my life time. But what puts this movie over the top as one of the all time greatest films ever made is the casting.

Sigourney Weaver is terrific but it is her supporting cast that shines and makes you feel like you know the crew that is heading to that desolate planet.

Paul Reiser is perfect as Burke,the slimy corporate kiss ass that cares about profit before human lives. Lance Henriksen shines as Bishop, the cyborg with a heart. Jeanette Goldstein is the rough around the edges female marine that more than holds her own with all the testosterone floating around and Michael Biehn ( another Cameron favourite )is the perfect quiet leader that leads by example and not so much a loud demonstrative voice. But the show stopper in this flick ( just as he always is in any movie that he is in ) is Bill Paxton.

Paxton and Cameron have worked on Terminator 1, True Lies, Titanic and Aliens and Bill is one of those actors that steals scenes from every actor and was always a recognizable face even before Titanic. Here, his Hudson character is the comic relief but he is also perhaps one of the true characters that we can all identify with. His tough exterior is nothing more than camouflage for his frightened fragile interior. He realizes the dire situation that they are all in and he can't hide his fear. When he finds out that they won't be rescued for at least seventeen days, his response is "" Hey man, we're not going to survive 17 hours man! Those things are going to come in here and they're going to get us and..... "" ( Ripley ) This little girl survived longer than that with no weapons and no military training. "" ( Hudson ) "" Why don't ya put her in charge!!! ""

Paxton is a gift to any and every movie that he is in and this is his finest work. He should have won a best supporting actor that year. And if you haven't seen this movie, rush to see it if only for Bill Paxton. He steals the show. But if a tightly wound, brilliantly technical and unbelievably scary movie is your thing, then you can't go wrong here. This is easily a ten out of ten, and one of the best ever made. If Spielberg is the king is Hollywood, then Cameron is his heir apparent. Oh, and one more thing, Paxton will win an Oscar one day."
45. Aliens,10/10,One of the most thrilling films ever- special edition highly recommended,"James Cameron is an extremely talented action director because not only does he know great action, but he always backs the action up with a great story and interesting characters. Aliens is his finest achievement, as far as I'm concerned. Of course, I should specify: Aliens Special Edition is his finest achievement.

In 1986 several scenes were cut to keep the movie's run-time reasonable but there was one scene that was incredibly foolish to leave out. The scene I refer to is near the beginning where Ripley learns that her daughter has died while she was away in 'hypersleep' for 57 years. ""I promised her I'd be home for her 11th birthday,"" cries Ripley. This is a very moving scene that adds a great deal the character's depth and makes more sense to why she cares for a little girl named Newt later in the film. She's seeking penance through Newt with her love and determination to keep her alive at all costs. The theatrical edition obviously doesn't elude to any of this, and even cheapens the relationship between Ripley and Newt- just a little bit. James Cameron has said that all of his movies are love stories, and Aliens is a story of parental love. He has also said that the special edition is his intended (if not definitive) version of the film. For about five years or so the Special Edition was the only version of Aliens you could get on DVD. It should have stayed that way.

Aliens is a unique film experience: it's genuinely thrilling and exciting, unlike a lot of movies where people shoot the evil monsters and there's disgusting blood and rapid gunfire, and it's really meaningless. In Aliens' case, the aliens are very threatening and more than just target practice. We don't see any aliens for over an hour, but once we do, it's a huge payoff. By that time, we get to know some interesting characters: Hicks (Michael Beihn), a take-charge marine who also turns out to be sweet and sincere, Hudson (Bill Paxton), a braggart who turns out to be a coward and complains most of the time, Vasquez (Jeanette Goldstein), the iron-willed woman soldier who proves to be one of the bravest characters in the film, Bishop (Lance Henrikson), a robot that is very helpful for everyone's survival, Burke (Paul Rieser), the slimy company man who the audience loves to hate, and of course, the adorable little Newt (Carrie Henn), a girl who has survived unspeakable horror. Holding the whole film together is Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver in her surprise-Oscar-nominated performance. I think the only reason why the audience cared for her in the first film is because she was the only person left and we wanted her to live. But for this film, James Cameron added so much to her. With all this investment in characters, we're really concerned for their well-being. We don't want those aliens to get them. Some die, and I'm always truly bummed out when it happens.

Filled with amazing performances and an abundance of thrills, Aliens is one of the greatest of any genre it attempts: whether it's action, sci-fi, horror, or even drama. I personally liked it better than the first film, but it's really like comparing apples and oranges. I prefer the special edition and don't see why anyone should view the other version instead.

My rating: 10/10"
45. Aliens,10/10,Gets better every time I see it,"I am just going to add my voice to the chorus of praise for this movie. It is as near to being perfect as any I have ever seen. I will not say that it is much better than Alien - which is just about near to being perfect also. But I do love all the characters in this movie. I have rarely seen a movie where all the characters were so well developed. Even most serious dramas seldom develops each character so completely. None of these characters are stereotypes even Paul Reiser as Burke, although the slimy company/government man villain is a prerequisite in disaster type movies. I would almost say that my favorite is Michael Beihn as Hicks, just because I like his work & consider him to be underrated. But I also like Lance Henriksen as Bishop, William Hope as Lt. Gorman, Bill Paxton as Hudson, and of course, Jenette Goldstein as Vasquez. I liked all of these characters. I cared about their lives & deaths. The final scene for Gorman & Vasquez still chokes me up after seeing it many times.

I am not ignoring Sigourney Weaver or Carrie Henn. Ripley is the template for the modern action heroine. In the 24 years since Alien, few have been able to measure up to Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. Even in Alien 3 & 4, Ripley was still powerful, despite the 3ed rate quality of the movies. As for Carrie Henn as Newt, she was the emotional heart of Aliens. Cameron's ability to develop well rounded characters does not detract from his ability to create great action scenes or to scare the audience out of a several years of growth."
45. Aliens,10/10,All-time classic; one of the greatest films ever made,"What more can be said that hasn't been said before about one of the greatest movies of our time? One of Jim Cameron's top three films, this is by far the best of the ALIEN saga, an endlessly rewatchable piece of classic action cinema which can best be described as ""Vietnam in space"". The alien is back and has multiplied, so now we have the now-classic action premise of ""group of marines vs. invincible enemy"".

From start to finish this is perfectly made entertainment with every frame minutely conceived to be the best. The music is eerily gripping and there are dozens of one-liners to be had from Bill Paxton, excelling in his first big role as the comic relief. The horror and gore quotient hasn't been reduced at all, this is definitely not a film for the kids. But oodles of gripping suspense and guns-blazing action violence is the main thing this sequel offers and it still remains one of the best action classics of our time. Even now, when some of the special effects are starting to look a little ropey (most remain fantastic, however, especially the Queen) and when you begin to realise there are no more than six aliens on screen at one time, this is still pulse-pounding entertainment, packed with horror, suspense, tension and plenty of thrills.

The cast is efficient, an ensemble outfit that pays off nicely. Sigourney Weaver puts in her best performance in her best role that she can never hope to better success-wise. Michael Biehn is the hard-but-human soldier who befriends her, Lance Henriksen has his mainstream breakthrough role as the likable android Bishop. Paul Reiser's Burke is one of the greatest portrayals of corporate evil I've seen, a fantastic show of strength, corruption, evil and cowardice from Reiser. The rest of the marines are great and, most importantly, believable and likable. The action never lets up and the extended version has to be seen to get the full story. Although it runs for two and a half hours this is a film that never runs out of steam; instead it will just age gracefully like the finest wines, sitting in its place in history as a classic of the '80s."
45. Aliens,8/10,"Action, horror n science fiction combined in an amazing way.","I first saw this in the late 80s on a vhs.

Revisited all the four parts in the early 2k on dvds which i own.

Revisited this part (154 mins special edition version) few days back as i am on Alien movie marathon n very impatient to check out Prometheus n Covenant.

This movie has some amazing star cast, lots of fireworks, intense action n claustrophobic horror.

45. Aliens,9/10,"This is how it's done, you morons","Welcome to 1986, where they had diverse AND well-written characters in what has to be one of the best Sci-Fi Action films of all time: ALIENS.

Even in 1979, Ellen Ripley was what those wannabes today want to recreate: a strong, yet believable female character with a real challenge and a highly competent movie around her. Now, imagine being tasked to do a sequel to ALIEN. You'd be right to directly spray your pants, go throw up, have a heart attack and then politely decline. But not James Cameron. He went on and made one of the most valuable and memorable sequels in film history, despite having a lot of nay-sayers in his own team who didn't believe he could pull it off. Oh, the balls this guy had.

Well, what can I tell you about this film that you don't already know? If you really haven't seen it, go watch it. Immediately. It basically is the American version of the suspenseful, British original, but it does get to expand on the world-building quite a lot, as well as on Ripley herself. Add Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton and a ton of Xenomorphs, paranoia, action, quite a bit of horror, Paul Reiser and Lance Henriksen and a badass called Vasquez, and you will have a cocktail that you won't forget, I promise. Then just realize that I didn't even mention Sigourney Weaver and holy cow, why are you still reading this?

Go watch this movie!"
45. Aliens,9/10,Great follow up,"It's 57 years after the first movie. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been lost in cryogenic sleep until she's discovered by a deep salvage team. She's asked to return to the planet to investigate why the colony there has lost all communication. She and a team of space marines must battle the aliens in an all out fight.

James Cameron has taken this franchise from its horror origins to a great big action adventure. The change in style is seamless. The action is perfect, and it's a non-stop roller coaster ride. Ripley has transformed herself from the feminist icon into a powerful mother figure. There isn't a false note in this movie. The characters are all well drawn from the humanist robot Lance Henriksen to the comic relief Bill Paxton. They all work to create one of the most thrilling rides of all times.

45. Aliens,10/10,"In space, nobody can hear you s**t your pants","57 years ago Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) was part of the Nostromo spaceship's crew that encountered a terrifying alien, as the last remaining member of the crew she has drifted through space in hyper sleep. Awake and alive nobody believes her, so she is asked upon to support a Colonial Marine outfit as they go back to Moon LV-426 - a now colonized moon where the original Alien came from. They have recently gone dark and potentially abandoned the moon, and the authorities want to know why. The Colonial Marines are outfitted with state of the art warfare machinery and an arsenal to potentially deal with any threat.

This is an amazing film - on par, if not better than the first in the series. It takes concepts from the first film, and then changes the approach and dynamic of the plot - expanding the universe in which the story unfolds. Some sequels just re-hash what came before them; this takes the original and does an A-Team transformation on it, attaching guns, lasers, nitro, bells and whistles. The end result is a genre bending action horror sci-fi chase war thriller masterpiece. There are explosions, special effects, gorgeous cinematography and mise-en-scene, great plot, thrilling story, top actors delivering excellent performances, scares, frights, fights, character development - oh believe me, I could go on singing the praises of this film. When James Cameron was given the reigns to this after Ridley Scott's seminal ""Alien"" film a lot of film-goes where dubious - but given the proof of the ""Terminator"" movie, Cameron had the pedigree to be successful and boy did he deliver! Not just a tour-de-force of a visual spectacle, but also a film lecturers dream as the material further promotes lots of themes and discussions - none more than the heroine who is the vehicle for plot. If the first film made people look at Sigourney Weaver differently, this film went a long way to elevating her star power as she totally flipped action hero conventions on their head - to this day her performance is still synonymous with being a major player in the change from masculine dominated cinema. The matriarchal bond shown between Ripley and Newt is great, the character development goes some way to showing an attempt to fix the fragility of the broken bond exemplified at the start of the film when it becomes clear that Ripley's own biological daughter is resentful of the unjustified absence of a mother. Another well documented discussion this film birthed deals with the parallels to war films, and in particularly Vietnam themed war film - however rather than shoehorning academic thesis' into this review I'll just say that the film did more than just entertained, it became an icon in cinema.

I seriously cannot give this film less than 10 out of 10. It scared, thrilled and entertained me as a child when I watched it (admittedly under the legal age), and it still keeps a smile on my face as I watch it as an adult."
45. Aliens,10/10,Who could believe that a sequel could top an already modern classic?,
45. Aliens,8/10,Good strong sci-fi action movie,"Ripley and Jones are rescued, but 57 years have past and humans now colonise the planet where the original Alien was found.

Can the Company get a crew of Marines out to the planet in time to save them? Can they survive themselves?

After being awoke from such a long hypersleep, Ripley's life is very different. The Company does not believe her story and she is striped of her profession. Even all her family have now passed away. She finds herself tortured by nightmares.

When the Company loses contact with the colony, after sending some colonists to investigate Ripley's story, they have a change of heart and send the crack Marines in to rescue the colonist but need Ripley's knowledge.

She eventually, reluctantly joins the trip as an advisor, as long as they kill the creatures they find.

When the team find that the colony is completely overrun with the creatures, survival becomes the only concern.

Strong sequel. Very different in mood, deliberately, as they move into a sort of siege story and the hide and seek of the first drifts away.

As a result this is a less effective horror story but is a very effective grownup sci-fi movie.

Although the Marines are all stereotypes, and they have the minimum required to cover all the options, they are well acted and the action is well paced.

Sigourney Weaver's second outing as Ripley allows the character greater depth and flexes some different acting muscles too. There is a believable set of relationships and dynamics between Ripley and the other characters, especially young ""Newt"", played by Carrie Henn. Indeed, the child steals many scenes from the more established actors.

Lance Heinrikson and Michael Biehn are always good to watch but Bill Paxton is superb as the 'comic relief' Hudson. Paul Reiser, very popular at the time, pulls in the slime as the Company man looking to make his fortune - at any cost.

The effects are good and the sets again very believable. The final showdown again grips.

Although this is a very effective sci-fi action movie it is not a traditional horror, lacking the menace of the original.

Things to look out for: nightmares, inquiry, queen alien, grunts, Newt, loads of one liners, another android."
45. Aliens,10/10,Hands down one of the best sequels ever!,"Back in 1986, sequels had become very common (Superman, Star Wars, Indiana Jones), yet people were suspicious when they heard of a follow-up to Alien, Ridley Scott's acclaimed sci-fi horror from 1979. Most of the criticism was aimed at the fact that Scott had nothing to do with the new movie, which had been entrusted to an unknown (at the time) named James Cameron. Fortunately, Cameron had shown he knew the genre two years earlier with The Terminator, and by perfecting the skills he had developed on that film he delivered Aliens, which still stands out as one of the greatest science fiction flicks of all time.

Given how the first film ended (all characters but one died), Cameron wisely decided to radically separate his movie from the original, and he does so from the very beginning by having Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) wake up from her cryogenic sleep and make a shocking discovery: although she hasn't aged at all, 57 years have passed since she left the Nostromo, meaning everyone she knew is either dead or very old (in a particularly heartbreaking scene, she talks on the phone with her grown-up daughter, who is full of resentment for her ""unjustified"" absence). In addition, no one believes her story regarding the alien since, as she's told by scientist Carter Burke (Paul Reiser), the planet where these creatures allegedly lived has been successfully colonized. Suddenly, though, all communications with LV-426 are inexplicably interrupted. Thinking there might be some truth to Ripley's tale, Burke asks her to join him and a group of soldiers on a mission to uncover the mystery. And while most of the participants are in it just for the money, our heroine realizes this is her only chance of confronting her worst nightmare and overcoming it for good.

The main problem with Alien, some have said, was that, as great as it can be, the characterizations were reduced to the minimum (not that it really mattered, with Ridley Scott ensuring the film retained the right pace and suspense throughout). With Aliens, character development is the last thing fans should worry about, Cameron being fully aware of each individual's potential and exploiting it as much as he can. Ripley, who was just part of an ensemble in the original, is now allowed to carry the whole film, and boy, does she carry it: rarely has there been a more solid, compelling female role in a genre movie like this (the fact that Sigourney Weaver is the only actress, thus far, to have received an Oscar nomination for a science-fiction film is further testament to Aliens' immortality). The supporting cast is equally good, with a multitude of different characters ranging from funny (regular Cameron collaborators Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton) to weird (Lance Henriksen's android Bishop) and bringing something extra to the movie's unique atmosphere.

Ah, the film's mood: that's the other aspect Cameron deserves all the credit in the world for. On a superficial level, it could be said Alien was a horror movie, while the follow-up is more action-oriented; that may be true, but one should also notice that every single spectacular battle scene actually oozes tension, never leaving the audience with a pause to breathe or relax. In fact, Cameron has succeeded where many other directors would have failed: he stayed faithful to the original's tone, but managed nonetheless to make the film undeniably his own.

Relentlessly creepy, occasionally very violent and consistently compelling, Aliens is a pitch-perfect piece of adult science-fiction. Watch it on a double bill with Scott's version and you will get four hours of genre film-making at its finest."
45. Aliens,10/10,This ain't a film.,"THE sci-fi movie. It's nearly perfect in every way: storyline, characters, menacing threat, suspense, action, direction, music, emotion, etc... It's always been a favorite of mine and still is. To me this is not just a film, it is an experience. The adrenaline pumps like in no other film and rarely have we had the chance to see a heroine as compelling as Sigourney Weaver. She can kick anyone's ass and still keep a heart and soul. (Why she didn't win the Oscar back in 1986 is beyond me.) When the action starts, you're in for the ride of your life. Truly a milestone in movie making. Now if they could only release it on DVD...

45. Aliens,9/10,ALIENS IS THE SCI-FI GENRE,
45. Aliens,8/10,Aliens (1986) Better than the first movie?,"There is a question among many people: Is Aliens (1986) better than Alien (1979)? I already advance that I don't think that and I don't think it comes close to being better. They are two films on completely different levels. Does that make this a bad movie? No way. Aliens is an excellent film with wonderful production design. Visually it's spectacular, and that's to be expected for a James Cameron film. His direction works very well and many scenes are striking and tense. The movie isn't bad at anything it does or tries to do, but it isn't perfect at those same things. The script is very good and the story is very well developed, but perhaps for the first one being simpler and in a more closed environment makes it better. Some characters don't work so well and you don't sympathize with them, making it just boring. Overall, it's an excellent film that looks amazing, but it's no better than its predecessor.

45. Aliens,8/10,Have you ever been mistaken for a man?.....,
45. Aliens,7/10,"Less terror, more action","After 7 years, ""Alien"" is back, this time brought by another great director, James Cameron, shifting the focus of the movie a little, bringing it from terror to action, but still without losing its origin completely. With an apathetic script, where we have a situation to bring the legendary lieutenant Ripley back to action, even though not being extremely creative, the script never gives in to ridicule, on the contrary, it takes itself seriously and we take it too seriously. 57 years after the events of ""Alien"", Ripley returns to the planet LV- 426 to help families who explore the place, this time accompanied by a troop of soldiers, the ""Aliens"" end up being underestimated ... With less terror and more Action, the script still pleases. Technically the film is exquisite, having the face of the 80's, but better done, packed with visual effects that appeal to this day, James Cameron does well. Lastly, ""Aliens"" is a good continuation and a natural evolution of Plot, characters and context, but will never have the charm and impact of its predecessor.

45. Aliens,10/10,The best Sci Fi action flick ever made,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? Every aspect of this movie is spot on, which I can only put down to James Cameron's obsessive attention to detail. The characters are distinct, memorable and believable. The plot builds slowly into the most tense, suspenseful roller-coaster ride I've ever experienced in the cinema. The special effects are good even by today's standards, and the sets are simply second to none. This is one of my top 10 favourite movies of all time.

If you like this kind of movie and haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for? Twenty years on and the only other Sci Fi action movie in the same league is James Cameron's Terminator 2. I can only hope he returns to this genre in the future, he is the master.

Oh, and try to see the special extended edition if possible, the extra scenes make an amazing movie even better.

45. Aliens,9/10,Could Hardly Be Improved.,
45. Aliens,10/10,"""I knew you'd come...""","ALIENS really does have it all. Perfect direction. Beautiful cinematography. Intense characters. Big guns. Action. Heroism. Courage. Battles. Friendship. Bravery. It is certainly the BEST sequel ever made in movie history, and one of the GREATEST MOVIES EVER MADE.

At its core is Lt. Ellen Ripley (played by the badass Sigourney Weaver), a warrant officer, and tough as nails. Her character is one of the greatest heroines of all time. Sigourney really does pull it off. No one else could have done it like her. Ripley's maternal connection with the young girl Newt is amazing to watch...but the ultimate scene is her final battle with the galaxy's most deadly creature - set to a pulsing military score (James Horner delivers in a big way!). Quite possibly my favorite fight scene of all time.

There's not really much else to say - just go watch the movie on DVD, and you will not be let down. You're in for a wild ride!!!

ALIENS: THIS TIME, IT'S WAR"
45. Aliens,7/10,"Make it a 7.5, and just don't think too hard!","When I recently revisited this film I was underwhelmed. I don't think I've sat through it a second time since it was in theaters in 1986. I remembered it as a great action film and it is still a great action film.

The main problem that I had - the problem I have with most James Cameron films - was the dialogue. He writes lines for these characters like they are caricatures rather than actual people. The proceedings come off shrill where the original Alien was a masterpiece of originality - monsters with acid for blood so you can't even kill them without killing yourself and destroying your spacecraft. At least I can't complain about the lack of originality of the material, because Cameron is writing and directing a sequel here.

It almost singlehandedly created the aesthetic of the ""space marine,"" which makes it really hard to not see their behavior as cliche, even if it did create the cliches. I also get that their macho posturing is supposed to contrast with how quickly they dissolve under pressure, but that isn't really a particularly fascinating character or plot development. You know from the start that they don't have a clue what they are getting themselves into. Did they not read Ripley's report like they were instructed to do? Yet not a one says ""Yikes!"" prior to first engagement with something that is not your typical big bad.

And the cliched mother/daughter relationship just springing up between Ripley and Newt is rather grating on the nerves too. I've never watched the extended version, but apparently Ripley had a daughter in the extended cut of Aliens who grew to adulthood and died during the 57 years Ripley was ""lost in space"". That would have had this spontaneous maternal reaction make more sense.

Cameron hits all of the tent pole emotional triggers - although he does it completely without nuance - the evil corporation that is just too big, prejudices accepted in an earlier era going out of fashion, and some people deserve to be rescued while others do not???? Oh, well, it is a great thrill ride. Cameron always does that well, and does it well enough here to make the film a suspenseful rollercoaster as long as you don't think too hard."
45. Aliens,10/10,Every bit as good as Alien,"Alien is a sci-fi classic, so when I saw Aliens I was expecting great things. Which is exactly what I got. Aliens I have often seen and heard being described as one of the best sequels ever made, and I have to heartily concur. Aliens is every bit as good as Alien, and just a brilliant film. The production design once again is immaculate with the spectacle surpassing Alien(to me), while the script is credible, the story interesting and well-constructed and James Cameron's direction brilliant. As with Alien, there are also some very genuine shocks and scares, and if there was something I marginally preferred here it was the suspense which was particularly nail-biting. The acting once again is top notch, all the supporting cast do great work but Sigourney Weaver is simply terrific and it helps that Ellen Ripley is expanded upon here. Overall, just like Alien, a sci-fi classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox

46. The Shining,10/10,"Forty years on, and it's still outstanding.","Kubrick, King and Nicholson, the writing was literally on the wall, and I don't mean RedRum, forty years on, and The Shining is still a masterpiece.

Kubrick takes King's fantastic book, and builds on it, bringing the story to life in his own inimitable way. It's dark, it's bleak, it's terrifying, a masterpiece in storytelling. You watch as the central character's mental collapse is played out in a spine chilling fashion.

Gorgeous camera work, incredible visuals, that opening is iconic. So many incredible, visual moments, the twins, lift, barman etc, no wonder it's been parodied multiple times over the years, famously by The Simpsons.

An iconic role for Jack Nicholson, he is incredible, well supported by a terrific cast.

It's a classic, 10/10."
46. The Shining,10/10,One of my favorite films,
46. The Shining,5/10,Equivocation,"This is a difficult review to write. You see, I've just posted comments on Ella Enchanted where I comment that, as someone who has never read the book, the film is absolutely fine. But it's difficult for me to approach Stanley Kubrick's The Shining on that basis because, you see, I've read Stephen King's The Shining.

If I do my absolute best to put the book out of my mind, I suppose that the film must be acknowledged as a tolerable horror, with two major flaws - one, it's overlong, and what should be a slow burn loaded with increasing dread becomes simply boring, and two, Jack Nicholson's established screen persona means that there is absolutely no suspense in his development from decent though flawed father/husband to scenery-chewing maniac - the final madness is there from the first frame he appears in.

If you've never read the book and you're a horror fan, then you'll probably enjoy it - no huge surprises, but it ticks most of the boxes. And it looks very good.

But what a missed opportunity! Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is a film about a man who goes mad in a haunted hotel. Stephen King's The Shining is a novel about an evil entity which inhabits a hotel, and which wants to consume a boy's psychic power: the boy is strong enough to resist it, so it works on the weakest link, the father, and gradually erodes everything which made him a good, decent man. Jack's transition from the decent though weak man he starts out as, to the point where the Overlook is in control of his every action, is absolutely central to Stephen King's The Shining, and it could only have worked on screen if Jack was portrayed by an actor who was initially credible as a decent, gentle man. Not Nicholson - I love him, but he was (in my view) a spectacular piece of miscasting for this movie. Picture Dustin Hoffman, Harrison Ford, or someone similar, and how dramatic and shocking their descent to axe-wielding maniachood would have been.The contrast is essential to Stephen King's story: with Nicholson, there was no contrast.

It is also worth commenting that King's The Shining is about a man who loves his family: Kubrick's The Shining is stated, by the screenwriter in one of the DVD documentaries, to be about a man who hates his family. A fairly fundamental difference, yes?

Ah well. ""What if""s never got us anywhere. Go and see Stanley Kubrick's The Shining anyway, and enjoy Jack Nicholson chewing scenery. The scenery's pretty good eye candy and, besides, he does it so well."
46. The Shining,10/10,An absolute classic. Even if it does stray away from the novel.,"While I can understand a lot of Stephen King's arguments over Kubrick's vision, including casting Jack Nicholson who instead of a descent into madness looks insane from the first frame. This is still an absolute classic.

46. The Shining,6/10,The book is better,"Watching this after reading the book I can see why Stephen king was annoyed with it.

Jack Nicholson looked unhinged from the beginning which means there isn't much difference in his decent into madness.

Certain characters from the book are left out, where are the bees? Where are the moving ani mail bushes? The boiler is barely mentioned.

The direction is brilliant and I love the blood down the elevator shaft scene.

46. The Shining,6/10,I can see why people like it,"My expectation were to high. I expected a masterpiece, but in the end I found it just mediocre. Dont get me wrong the acting and the camera work are great. Storywise I couldnt really get invested in it. In terms of horror except the twins it wasn't scary at all in my opinion.

46. The Shining,9/10,The best creepy horror movie involving isolation n eeriness. Also it captured the fear of the unseen in one of the best way.,"I first saw this in the late 80s on a vhs, then again in the early 2k on a dvd which I own. Revisited the 144 mins director's cut recently as i am anxious to check out Doctor Sleep n the tv version of The Shining.

Everything has already been said about this film n there seems to be little left to say but as a fan of horror movies (especially to do with isolation n eeriness), lemme contribute by praising how good this film is n at the same time why it doesn't deserve a full 10.

The film has solid amount of tension n scare factor.

The vast isolation, the snow capped peaks, the valleys, the mountains, the narrow, winding roads, the snow covered roads, the eerie corridors, they all add to the film's narration.

The start scene wher Jack is driving and the background music, itself gives goosebumps n a sign that something sinister is awaiting.

On a technical level this film is gr8, the music, the visuals, the camera angles, etc all add to it except the lead actor Nicholson.

Nicholson was already well known for playing unstable characters and his character Jack in this film is shown to be a bit wierd from the beginning.

They shud have asked him to potray a normal family loving person in the beginning n later show the gradual transition into madness n possession.

Who wud discuss Donner Party in front of a kid?

Also the way Jack gives an evilish smile when his kid tells about watching cannibalism on tv.

What kinda parent wud approve of that?

Also most of the time Jack's behavior is more laughable.

Even when he is hit on the head by his wife n he falls down, it is a big lol."
46. The Shining,5/10,Overrated,"Once again, I decided to check out a highly regarded ""cinematic masterpiece"" and was left kinda disappointed. Scariest movie of all time? No, not really. It wasn't even particularly scary.

Admittedly, a lot of it was well done. The little girls were the best part. They were great. The steadicam shots through the hallways were pretty cool. There was a good sense of ""What horrors could be lurking around the corner?"" as the camera follows the kid through the halls.

But aside from those things, much of the movie didn't work so well. Jack Nicholson was more hilarious than menacing. Was that intentional? His witty dialogue provided many laughs, but watching him slowly stumbling around holding an axe was hardly what I'd call horror.

The story was completely nonsensical. What was any of that? There's no explanation for almost everything that happens in the movie! Here's where I'll probably get derided by the movie's fans for not ""getting it,"" but I'm convinced this is really a case where the movie-makers themselves had no clue what it all meant. They just threw all this random imagery at us just to confuse us and convince us that it's actually brilliant (because if we can't comprehend any of it, it must be brilliant, right?) but really it just makes zero sense.

I don't get why this is so highly rated."
46. The Shining,6/10,A major disappointment.,"This has got to be the most overrated movie in the history of film. I just watched it for the first time, expecting the best of the best, and it was quite a letdown. The sets and music are great, of course, but Kubrick seems to have forgotten one very important thing: to make a horror movie horrifying, you have to have likable characters. That way, when bad things start happening, the audience feels for them.

What we have here, however, is a documentary on the most dysfunctional family in the world. Isn't this supposed to be about a loving husband and father who goes insane? Jack Nicholson is brilliant at portraying total insanity, but there's no gradual shift into at all. He looks like he's about to snap from scene one. His wife is a whimpering, nervous wreck who does not seem to trust him at any point throughout the movie. And the kid, Danny, is just a weird little nut. Who can identify with these people?

Another major problem is that there is no clear storyline here. The whole first half of the movie is about the kid's psychic abilities, and then it does a total switch and focuses on Jack Nicholson being crazy. What was the point of spending all that time on Danny? It seems like it is foreshadowing something, but it never amounts to anything. I guess Danny is the first one to see ghosts in the house, but that is not a big enough plot point to spend the entire first half of the movie on.

Other than some incredibly creepy music and sets, there is nothing really scary in this movie. It is fun to see Jack Nicholson ham it up, of course, but there is no scariness involved when you spend the entire movie waiting listlessly for him to pick up an ax, rather than being shocked when he goes from lovable to psychotic. Instead, he goes from obviously-wanting-to-release-a-ton-of-built-up-aggression to psychotic, which is extremely inferior.

6/10 stars, and that is being generous."
46. The Shining,10/10,A masterpiece of psychological horror,"""The Shining"" by Stanley Kubrick explores the question of who is the reliable observer and whose ideas of events can be trusted. The opening scene at a job interview introduces Jack Torrance, a man who plans to live in solitude with his wife and son at the snowbound Overlook Hotel. His employer warns him about a former caretaker who murdered his wife and two daughters, but Jack assures him that this will not happen. His wife, a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict, is likely to be fascinated by the story. Jack, Wendy, and Danny move into a hotel during winter shutdown, where the chef, Dick Hallorann, explains the food storage locker. They are left alone, and Jack works tirelessly at his typewriter, while Wendy and Danny create a routine of everyday life, including breakfast cereal, toys, and TV. The three don't seem to function as a loving family, as they are constantly occupied with their daily routines. The question remains whether people will talk about real tragedies or if Jack will ever tell his wife about it. Danny, a reliable witness, is influenced by Tony, who channels psychic input, including a vision of blood spilling from hotel elevators and two matching girls. However, these visions may not accurately represent the actual events. Wendy, a companion and playmate for Danny, has a matter-of-fact banality similar to Shelley Duvall's ""3 Women."" She tries to cheer Jack up until he abruptly stops interrupting his work. Wendy later discovers the reality of his work, and is reliable at that moment and later when she bolts Jack into the food locker after he becomes violent. The opening shots of Jack wending his way up the Colorado mountains are a sign of what's to come. The eerie Moog interpretation of Hector Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique, the mirroring of the landscape against a placid lake, and the breathless whoosh of the camera are all signs of what's to come. With Steadicam mounts, Kubrick experiments with how a constantly roving camera can unmoor an audience. Even in the benign early scenes of Jack heading to the interview or the Torrance clan getting a tour of the hotel, it feels like a game of chicken. As the Torrances settle into The Overlook for the winter and a snowstorm severs their connection to the outside world, the madness that quickly seizes Jack ramps up a whole strategy of disorientation. Kubrick makes a joke out of titles announcing different days of the week, as if time has any meaning in isolation. The geography of The Overlook is impossible to map, with the kitchen, living quarters, Gold Room, upper floors, and Room 237 all distinct spaces that are impossible to connect."
46. The Shining,10/10,Straight Up,"The sound, editing, camera and mise en scene are all utilized perfectly. A perfect score, framing, cinematography, camera work, set, production design, acting, storytelling, and not only just a perfect horror movie, but a perfect film. This film is what all great films STRIVE to be. The highest of film standards.

The Shining is a masterwork of creating mood, setting tone, and developing an atmosphere. The score is one of the best and most iconic scores of all time. As well as the most eerie.

This is honestly my favorite of all Stanley Kubrick's films. The Shining is a masterpiece of cinema *chefs kiss*

The only thing that is a negative imo is that if your not completely invested in the movie and ready to sit down and watch, you will get bored. It's lengthy, but worth it once your totally engrossed in the film. Especially for your first viewing. You gotta pay attention."
46. The Shining,10/10,A MASTERPIECE LIKE NO OTHER,"Whenever we hear the name Stanley Kubrick, the poster, scene or a shot from The Shining will come to our mind - most probably "" Here's Johnny!"". For a legendary filmmaker like Kubrick who has multiple masterpieces to his credit, would still be fine if he had never even made this film. But still, there would be some great missing which will be felt! That's because of The Shining's ability to penetrate into the viewer's mind, even the subconscious, and imprint an influence in it's deeper depths. How the movie hooks the viewer with its horror which is created from several dimensions are a remarkable factor which makes this film an all-perfect masterpiece which is thrilling and exciting even after watching umpteen number of times.

How Kubrick created the horror, just one among the many factors which makes the film a great one (still a very important one though), is so deep and mind-blowing, he builds tension in the viewer with enough substance written in the screenplay to showcase on the screen, and perfectly well-tuned and tastefully directed horror. And most importantly, the background music and sounds which has immense depth with it's structuring crafted to the innermost core and the finely touched upper layers. And the actors who gives performances which are dramatically aesthetic and showcases face expressions which are realistic to the utmost extent. As the film progresses the anticipation for something scary to expect in the upcoming scenes are created successfully and the anticipation which it created was also executed by scaring the viewer with horrors of huge intensity.

One thing which is found in this film, is in fact something of a variety. It's the portrayal of the supernatural in a very realistic manner, which is done in an absolutely subtle way which doesn't let the viewer know that it's a realistic portrayal of the supernatural, in fact he won't even care to notice it. Because that's how successfully it's done. And what's the use of it? It gives an impact on the viewer which affects the way in which he percieves the film, and that too which will be something of an advantage for the filmmaker.

I don't intend to say anything about the story of the film, whether it's supernatural horror or the breakdown of a madman's mind, is still debated among cinephiles, even after 40 years of the film's release. And that's also a thing which makes the film a great one! Rather than just showing what the maker wants to show, Kubrick let's the viewer decide what the film is, by making him analyse the film in his own perspective and coming up with an interpretation. And this is a form of interactive cinema, an indirect one though.

The Shining is one the greatest horror masterpieces, or even one of the best films of all time."
46. The Shining,8/10,One of the scariest movies ever---8/10,"I was never a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children. They usually lack originality and contain overacting galore. The only horror movie i like was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was well-acted, and had a great story. But it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, quite possibly the scariest movie ever.

The movie follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumors of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family. But Jack is convinced it will be OK and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block. After months of solitude and silence however, Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent. Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad?

One of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that Kubrick makes. The hotel is very silent, and the rooms are huge, yet always empty. It is also eerily calm when Jack's son is riding his bike through the barren hallways. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of his very best, scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile. My favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walk-in refrigerator.

The Shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion, beating the snot out of crap like the Ring and The Blair Witch Project. It may be a oldie, but is definitely a goodie. 8/10"
46. The Shining,9/10,Amazing achievement in filmmaking and the art of terror.,"Chilling, majestic piece of cinematic fright, this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller, with the grand vision of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot, an ice-cold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization. This movie cuts through all the typical horror movies like a red-poker through a human eye, as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist, but appreciate the seed from which the derangement stems. One of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind. The setting is perfect, in a desolate winter hideaway. The quietness of the moment is a character in itself, as the fermenting aggressor in Jack Torrance's mind wallows in this idle time, and breeds the devil's new playground. I always felt like the presence of evil was dormant in all of our minds, with only the circumstances of the moment, and the reasons given therein, needed to wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victims. This film is a perfect example of this very thought.

And it is within this film's subtle touches of the canvas, the clackity-clacks of the young boy's big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel, the labyrinthian garden representing the mind's fine line between sane and insane, Kubrick's purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies, continuity errors and set mis-arrangements, that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible, but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown. I have never read the book upon which the film is based, but without that as a comparison point, I am proud to say that this is one of the most terrifying films that I have ever seen. I thought that the runtime of the film could've been cut by a little bit, but then again, I am not one of the most acclaimed directors in the history of film, so maybe I should keep my two-cent criticisms over a superb film, to myself. All in all, this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision, ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction, and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold-eyed view of the man's mind gone overboard, creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity.

Rating: 9/10"
46. The Shining,9/10,timeless terror,"Even though The Shining is over a quarter of a century old, I challenge anyone to not get freaked out by Jack Nicholson's descent into madness. This is a rare example of something so unique that no one has been able to rip it off; instead it has been referenced time and again in pop culture. The twins, the elevator of blood, RedRum, the crazy nonsense ""writing""... this should be seen, if for nothing else, to understand all the allusions to it in daily life. The film is simultaneously scary, suspenseful, beautiful, and psychologically intriguing. It has the classic mystery of Hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller. And it has what horror movies usually lack: a great script.

46. The Shining,7/10,"There's no denying the impact it made, I'm just not the biggest fan","There is no denying the impact that The Shining made when it was released. It's on almost every list of all-time greatest horror films and has been endlessly parodied and referenced in other works. However, I've never been a huge fan of it. I think this movie is well-made, and it definitely has iconic moments of terror & suspense, but some of the surrealist scares just don't work for me. And there were scenes that pulled me out of the story because of the way they were shot. It almost felt as if Stanley Kubrick were demanding people pay attention to him. I just think The Shining is a little... overrated.

46. The Shining,6/10,Good...but not as good as some say.,"I liked this movie, but how it is ranked so high is beyond me. There are some pretty scary images in the movie, but on the whole it is not that scary. In fact, for the most part it is just watching people putter around a hotel by themselves and one of them goes insane. The boys powers are for the most part ignored, and it is a major part of the book. Though I myself would have loved to have driven around on a big wheel through a hotel at that age it doesn't really belong in this movie either, what the kid can't be walking and discover stuff? Jack though does a great job as the father, though he seems a bit to insane at the beginning so him going crazy is definately not a surprise. All in all a few scary scenes here and there, but this one to me is just an ok movie, not the scariest movie by any stretch of the imagination.

46. The Shining,1/10,Probably the most overrated movie of all times,
47. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,10/10,One of the most successful movies of all time (and I'm not talking about the Box Office take),"What made this the hugely successful triumph it was? Was it casting, music, imagination, ingenuity, or luck?

I remember opening day at the theaters. I was old enough to remember every scene, every character, every nuance of this film; having committed it to memory forever, as if I would never again be able to see this beloved, instantly loved masterpiece.

I also remember that the HIT factor of this movie was so unexpected that you had to wait literal MONTHS to get the action figures promised on the cereal boxes. The pieces were still in the manufacturing process and we had to settle for coupons promising our toys in a few months. I wound up seeing this in the theaters a grand total of 36 times; much to my mother's dismay. She loved the movie as I did, but felt I was obsessed. Today, thirty years later, sitting here writing this review, I realize how right she was. I'm still obsessed with this movie, and with the subsequent movies which followed. I wait in great anticipation for Episode 3. I'm a fan, and I don't care what other people say about Episodes 1 & 2. I don't even mind the ""prequel"" factor, as the situation at the time, dictated to Lucas which movies he would do first.

See, I remember the studios saying to him that he had to choose from the three central climactic books, and trash the rest, or just trash the whole idea. He didn't exactly ""sell out,"" he did what he had to do to get his movie...his vision...out there for us to see and experience. I admired his decision then, and I admire it now. Episodes 1-3 are being filmed now, because Lucas had the clout, the money, and the patience to give us his vision...his complete vision and not just the three center books of a 9-book series. I realize that now, there are dozens of books, but at the time, there were nine. And while most of us were happy with Episodes 4-6 and would not have missed 1-3 and 7-9, I personally am so very glad he has taken it upon himself to give us his full vision. I have enjoyed each and every installment with the same sense of awe and joy as I did this one.

The casting was the first triumph for this cinematic milestone. Ford is a charismatic and magnetic personality and portrayed Han with a professionalism that you'd expect from more seasoned actors. Sir Alec Guiness is an absolute joy as Obi Wan. His casting was precise and excellent in that part. Carrie Fisher portrayed Leia in a way that, up until then, had never been experienced. Most ""princess"" types before her were whining, whimpering, little snots who were incapable of anything beyond tripping and twisting their ankle in times of peril, while Fisher portrayed her character as a bold, brazen, yet sophisticated and educated woman who was aware of her surroundings and capable of defending herself and her realm with the utmost authority.

And Mark Hamil. He was perfectly cast as the whining little boy who wanted more, but was afraid to reach for it. He grows up quite well on film in these three installments, and endears himself to the audience so much the more for it. But a cast member who is almost always left out of these reviews is Peter Mayhew. Chewbacca. His character, as a supporting character to Han's, was exemplary. It's not easy portraying a walking carpet, yet holding the attention, admiration, and love of virtual millions. I am VERY happy about his being cast as Chewy in Episode 3. Couldn't happen to a more deserving...or capable...fellow. Bravo! And James Earl Jones's voice being used as the voice of Darth Vader, was pure genius. His commanding voice haunted the dreams of countless thousands of star-struck children for generations to come. I also have to say that this movie would not have had the charm it does had it not been for Anthony Daniels' C3P0. He is a gift and a joy.

The musical score by John Williams featured in this masterpiece was one of the contributing factors. But honestly, this movie's success was such a total surprise to everyone, including Lucas, that nothing could prepare the world for the aftermath of having witnessed this bona fide legend, first hand.

The story itself; replete with sub-plot after sub-plot, rich in dialog and detail, was beyond anyone's greatest expectations. Everyone, including Lucas, expected this movie to fail. It is a timeless classic, which I will not repeat here. There are too many movie reviews giving full details of the plot, and I won't be redundant beyond what I have already said.

However, that being said, there are a few points I would like to make concerning the symbolism of this endeavor. The Force is a metaphor for the psychic abilities with which we are all born. It was also a metaphor for hope and faith, dedication and commitment to the greater state of being. The Empire is said to have been a metaphor for the Germanic Nazi ""storm troopers."" While the Rebellion is said to have been symbolic of (what would later become) the NATO forces who defeated them.

And then there are the effects. The effects were, in 1977, so awesome; so creative; so ahead of their time, as to ensure this movie's vast success for the next forty years. George Lucas enjoys an almost god-like status among sci-fi/fantasy fans worldwide.

This movie does not rate a rating. Usually, when I say that, it is because the movie is so bad, or disappointing that I don't have the heart to rate it.

But in this case, it far surpasses any 10/10 rating I could give it.

47. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,10/10,A film that changed the industry forever.,"The Empire look set to continue their relentless war effort, new technology means they are pretty much unopposed, but a small band including Like Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo, look to fight back.

I'm not sure what I can add that hasn't already been said, instead I'll try and imagine what it must have been like for someone, someone young perhaps, heading to the cinema in 1977, seeing this film for the first time.

Consider what had gone before, people had Star Trek, and various other shows, but this film must have left audiences speechless, as there was quite literally nothing else like it.

This film changed not just sci fi, but film making in general, the sheer scale and imaginative of it shame many of today's mediocre offerings.

You have to admire the sheer bravery and audacity to get this film made, you wonder what doubts George Lucas had, he must have been elated when audiences turned round and fell in love with it.

47. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,10/10,The classic...,"Having grown up with the ""Star Wars"" trilogy, then ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" is a classic in every sense of the word. This is the epic story of good vs. evil and of light vs. dark. But it is also a story of heroism, bravery and adventure. I am an fan-boy, yes, but what is there not to love about ""Star Wars""?

George Lucas really managed to piece together a timeless classic that stands its own even today. And even with effects from 1977 it was light years ahead of its time, no pun intended. And the effects stand their ground even by todays standards.

There is something uniquely amazing about the atmosphere and feel of the ""Star Wars"" universe. And it doesn't require much to be swept away and carried along to a galaxy far, far away...

The cast in ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" did a good and memorable job with their individual roles and characters. And with this movie George Lucas established some characters that instantly became well-known and well-loved.

""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" is a movie of high space adventure with vibrant characters, creatures and spaceships. It is an enjoyable movie for the entire family, space nerds or not.

If you are not already familiar with the legendary ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" movie, then it is more than due time to get to it."
47. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,9/10,"The Best of Sci-Fi Times,the Worst of sf Times","Though now known as ""Episode IV-A New Hope,"" for many of us, namely those of us who first saw this exhilarating entertainment in theaters back in '77, this will always be the first ""Star Wars."" We will always think of it as just ""Star Wars"" - plain & simple, no pretensions, no aspirations to deep film-making or high art. This is where we first met them all: Luke, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi (old 'Ben'), Chewbacca, the 2 robots C3PO & R2D2 and, of course, Darth Vader. They were instant pop culture icons; you got the sense you'd seen them before somewhere, but were sure this wasn't possible. But they'd been there before in our minds. We'd read about them constantly in science fiction novels and short stories - tales of outer space civilizations, of spaceships zooming through asteroid belts, of exotic-looking aliens hanging around space ports. We'd dream about them at night and try to imagine ourselves in their midst; up until then, we could only imagine such things - there were no projected images to realize such dreams. ""Forbidden Planet"" from 1956 came close, and then there were the ""Star Trek"" and ""Lost in Space"" TV series, both hampered by dime store budgets and cheesy sets. We ate 'em up since there was nothing else. Then Lucas made it real.

I remember when I first got wind of the upcoming movie, to open in May of 1977, I think. I saw the first publicized poster and bought the novel adaptation. On the poster, a young man stood with some light sword raised, a princess at his feet, numerous spaceships flying all over the place. I was in my mid-teens and felt the first pulse of building excitement as I realized all those fantastic tales I'd been reading the past few years were going to come alive on the big screen for me. It didn't disappoint. Luke Skywalker, who stood in for all the boys pretending to be on a galactic adventure, gets swept away from his mundane desert home smack dab into the middle of an honest-to-gosh galaxy-wide civil war! The strength of the narrative is / was amazing. There are no slow spots and you can't wait for the next scene during the entire experience; and, experience is the better description for it, rather than just 'movie.' You can't wait, for example, for the moment when Luke actually meets the princess; what will happen then? It's a textbook case of an exciting narrative and what I believe makes this superior to all the sequels (knowing that many feel ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is superior - I must disagree).

The one character you really can't wait to see again is the ominous Vader, naturally. The instant he steps into view during the first few minutes of the story, you just know this is the ultimate villain. This is the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool, the supreme uber-evildoer of the entire galaxy. You just know it by his stance, by his attitude, and by the electric chill that runs through your frail form as he steps down the corridor, moving into the annals of film history with one fell swoop. You can't wait to see what he does next, what nefarious action will send someone or some planet to its doom. Sure, he seems under the control of Tarkin (Cushing) here and later, the Emperor, but you just know he's simply biding his time until he takes over the whole damn universe. There is no precedent for Vader, and nothing close to him after. He's at his best here where there's still much mystery attached to his dark frightful form, a minion of Satan and Nazi stormtroopers all rolled into one.

This was also the movie-experience which catapulted Harrison Ford (Solo) into superstardom. He seems almost childish here, not really straining to create a character, and it's this flip charm that makes it work, against all odds. He really does appear to have stepped out of the pages of some juvenile space opera, laser guns blazing, all snide remarks and foolhardy bravado. But he also becomes the older brother figure to Luke, who cannot carry the story by himself. Hamill, whose movie career began & ended with Luke, epitomizes the center of destiny for a galaxy. Both humble and arrogant, he's perfect in the role. Fisher's main surprise is that she's not all sugar and sweet as one would expect of a princess. These three characters evolved in the next two films, but they were always at their best here, icons given life for a short period - but also forever in film. The same could be said for Alec Guinness as Kenobi, a first class act all the way. You almost believe this elderly warrior could topple an empire, given enough time. Unless he runs into Vader..."
47. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,10/10,"The Force will be with you, always.","""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...""

Pre review:

Its writing started in January 1973, ""eight hours a day, five days a week"", George Lucas said by taking small notes, inventing odd names and assigning them possible characterization... After many drafts, he finally came to a satisfactory conclusion.

Then, Lucas presented Star Wars to the United Artists, but they refused to budget the film, so he went to Universal Pictures, the studio that financed American Graffiti; however, it was rejected, as the film concept was ""too strange"".

Suddenly, Alan Ladd Jr -head of 20th Century Fox- appeared, a man that trusted in Lucas' genius. And that's how Star Wars became a reality.

The shooting of the movie was full of mishaps, problems with practical effects never done before, a bad first edit of the movie, but that didn't stop George from fulfilling his Space Opera. Due to those setbacks, Fox Studios began to put pressure on Lucas to finish the movie. Finally, the movie was done. On the eve of Star Wars release, 20th Century Fox, George Lucas and his cast and crew braced themselves for the worse. One way or another, May 25, 1977 would be a day they would never forget...

Review:

Star Wars is a modern tale of mythic adventure. It follows the journey and growth of the protagonist: Luke Skywalker. His journey of discovery is set amidst a larger struggle between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance; both parties are embroiled in a civil war. The Empire is comprised of corrupted power within a small group of leaders. These sullied leaders abuse their power over the masses with impunity. It is oppression and repression of the masses. The Empire wants to destroy the hope of the rebellion to ensure the small group of leaders can keep their power...

One of the most important features of the movie are the special effects. The use motion control was even superior to Stanley Kubrick's revolutionary masterpiece: ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" thanks to the creation of The Dykstraflex, the first digital motion control photography camera system developed for Star Wars on 1976. Along with an incredibly iconographic character and production design, the movie became stylistically unique.

The story and the characters are original and relatable. R2-D2 and C-3PO: the astromech as the optimistic adventurer's desiring to move forward. In direct opposition C-3PO, the protocol droid filled with doubt and reservations. Luke Skywalker, the brave hero, often haunted by doubts and hopes about his future journey. Obi-Wan Kenobi, the wise master and moral guidance of our hero. Han Solo, the rebellious smuggler whose personality represents tenacity. Leia, the damsel ""in distress"", a fearsome princess and general. Finally, Darth Vader, the most iconic character in the franchise, the merciless tyrant in a black suit, representing evil and final conflict of the journey.

The film score presents an emotional resonance trough a romantic 1930s Hollywood orchestral score that was commissioned for composer John Williams, who succeeded to create a haunting constellation of operatic leitmotifs.

The visual composition is authentic, as Lucas wanted a nostalgic ""filtered look"" so he kept changing key lights for a ""flashing"" effect. He used a loose, ""nervous"" frame, as in newsreels. The dramatic center was displaced, deflecting the eye to background activity, which in later films would include poetically changing weather. This first film gradually turned darker, following a symbolic color scheme where organic brown and warm gold yielded to high-tech black, white, and steely gray."" This is authenticity is reflected in it's most iconic shot: the 'Binary Sunset' sequence, which establishes the narrative through-line of the story and the world it takes place in, the main value of the scene lies in how powerfully and economically it develops Luke's character: As the suns begin to slowly sink in the evening sky, he gazes towards the horizon, his sense of longing for something more is palpable. Taking things further, he goes on to squint into the distance as if he could see his new future just out of reach, and for the first time we get to see him not as a kid, but for as a new hope.

Books such as ""The hero with a thousand faces"" by Joseph Campbell structured the story, The War of Vietnam inspired the battle between the Rebels and the Empire, the lifestyle of buddhist monks characterized the Jedi, real shots of warplanes made the space battles real, Kendo foreshadowed the epic lightsaber duel, Akira Kurosawa's storytelling influenced the focus on minor characters, Fritz Lang's it's iconic protocol droid and John Ford westerns determined it's soul.The fascination with filmmaking and anthropology are the components that allowed Star Wars to be compelling and human, besides being located on a galaxy far, far away.

47. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,10/10,A milestone in film-making- a superlative sci-fi movie,"I couldn't have asked for anything more. Star Wars: A New Hope had it all. If I had to sum it up in one word, superlative would be my answer. I saw the film for the first time three months ago and loved it, and since then I have watched all the Star Wars movies. I was disappointed with the prequels (Attack of the Clones was my least favourite), but this, Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back were perfection.

I have to say that the film looks absolutely amazing even after thirty plus years, with highly imaginative sets and dazzling special effects. And the action sequences were superbly choreographed and brisk, the Death Star climax was a knockout. The music by John Williams is absolutely outstanding, by far one of his more exciting and rousing scores. The story is fast-paced, intelligent and has an essence of sophistication, and the screenplay is sharp and decisive.

And the performances were flawless. In the prequels I had problems relating to some of the performers, namely Hayden Christensen as Anakin. Here, all the actors played their parts with superlative skill. Alec Guiness, one fine actor and will be sorely missed was a standout, likewise with Peter Cushing and Harrison Ford(hilarious here). Carrie Fisher was a fine Princess Leia, spunky, beautiful and sexy, and Mark Hamill was a completely likable Luke. And the villain Darth Vader, without doubt one of the best and in-depth villains in cinematic history, and James Earl Jones's deep booming voice was perfect for the character.

All in all, a definite sci-fi classic, that blew me away. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
47. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,10/10,The greatest cinematic epic of all time begins here.,"Here begins the greatest cinematic epic of all time, and arguably one of the greatest stories ever told. Originally conceived as a serialized popcorn movie in the manner of the old action movies that Lucas grew up with, Star Wars surpassed even George's keen and bombastic imagination to become a central part of movie history.

There are countless tales of the making of this movie; how Lucas never believed he would get the chance to complete the series, how it spawned an industry and made the name of nearly everyone who touched it a household word. But what that does not reveal, nor do the much diminished prequels, is the sheer joy and excitement these movies generated.

It was a once in a lifetime experience. You could feel it from opening day, earlier if you paid attention to such things. We had never seen anything like it, and we are not likely to again.

This episode finds young Luke Skywalker yearning to leave the agrarian life he has with his aunt and uncle, and chase after adventure as his friends before him have already done. And what adventure there is. The galaxy is in the grip of a massive rebellion against a tyrannical and oppressive empire, but on Luke's home planet, it's something you only dare speak of in a whisper.

Along come two robots, ""Droids"" for short, who inadvertently involve Luke in a stellar attempt to contact an old wizard named Ben Kenobi, who lives in the caves near Luke's home.

The rest is history, and there isn't a person alive in the civilized world who doesn't have at least some awareness of the epic story that unfolds. Luke's rise from adolescent obscurity on Tatooine to a leading role in the greatest struggle of all time is told with humor, action, adventure, and always a sense of story that is unmatched on the screen or on the page.

With the completion of the prequel trilogy, these films are enjoying a renewed popularity among a generation that never saw the films on the big screen, and the theatric revivals are almost guaranteed. Go. Get some popcorn. And may the Force be with you."
47. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,10/10,Where It All Began-----10/10,"I can never pick a favorite movie because different movies have different effects. Goodfellas is my favorite drama. Face/Off is my favorite actioner. But when it comes to pure amazement, nothing beats Star Wars. We are introduced to a whole other universe with different creatures, different lifestyles, and different history. We are dropped in the middle of an intergalactic war between an empire and a rebellion that has raged for years and left the universe in ruin. It was the most fascinating thing to see when i was eleven, but to this day i am still a Star Wars nerd.

The cast of characters includes some of the coolest, funniest, and most tragic in film, and the actors who play them fit seamlessly into this new universe. Alec Guiness is flawless as Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Jedi on the run from the evil Empire. Harrison Ford is awesome as Han Solo, a smuggler and thief who helps the gang rescue the princess. But the my favorite character of all time is Darth Vader. Not only is he the coolest bad guy, but we learn in later films why he is evil and start to feel sympathetic for him. Not to mention that badass booming voice that can make ordering a pizza sound threatening.

This was not only the beginning of the best movie series ever, but it was the beginning of my love for movies. George Lucas is a genius for being able to come up with a great story and an incredible backdrop for what was supposed to be a flop, but turned into one of the best films ever.

10/10"
47. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,10/10,In A Galaxy Far Away................A Franchise Was Born,"The awesome special effects and the creation of creatures that are part of the vivid imagination of George Lucas are not the reason for the enduring popularity of Star Wars and the franchise it spawned. Rather it is because of the characters Lucas created that will live as long as we have cinema and the means to display it.

The spectacle is behind some real, but simple people. No shadings of gray in the first Star Wars we know without any doubt who the heroes and villains are of this piece. On an isolated planet a galaxy wide dictatorship called the Empire and the revolt against come to wear young Luke Skywalker as played by Mark Hamill and his family reside. So does Alec Guinness, a reclusive and mysterious hermit.

An escape pod crashes there with two androids, C3PO and R2D2 and in the latter is a message for Guinness who was at one time a Jedi Knight, fiercest of a warrior class, from Carrie Fisher playing Princess Leia. Also in R2D2 are the schematics for the Empire's ultimate weapon the satellite size death star that can deal killing out on a planetary scale.

This starts an adventure with young Hamill who teams up with futuristic soldier of fortune Harrison Ford as Han Solo and his simian like sidekick Chewbacca to rescue the Princess and defeat the Death Star.

Those are the good guys. The bad guys are the blackest of black villainy. Peter Cushing cold bloodedly commands the Death Star, but the mysterious Darth Vader, clad in black with a helmet completely covering his head, has mysterious powers and even his superiors are wary of him. The voice of James Earl Jones is unforgettable as the black prince of the galaxy.

These are characters that bring out the kid in all of us. The ones who claim the most sophistication in their lives will cheer on for Hamill and Ford and will be fascinated by the double dyed villainy of Darth Vader.

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Star Wars and I speak now of all the films is the way such non-humans as the robots and Chewbacca the Wookie became characters. C3PO had dialog, but R2D2 had a few clicks and bleeks and all Chewbacca did was grunt, still they became as identifiable as the human characters.

Star Wars set the standard for science fiction films to come for the next several generations. It was given six Oscars in a bunch of technical categories and it's got a re-release value that Gone With The Wind used to have.

The Force Will Be With Us Always."
47. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,9/10,A long time ago in a decade without CGI...,
47. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,10/10,"In 1977, in a galaxy far, far away...","This great classic has so many good elements it's almost impossible to list them all: The breathtaking visual effects, still awesome 28 years on; the brilliant script, which mixed epic battles and duels with matinée-serial-style characters and dialogues; the debut of one of the greatest villains in cinema history, Darth Vader; John Williams'amazing and unforgettable score, among the Top 10 best scores ever...

All those things are just some of the reasons Star Wars is among the best movies (not just sci-fi) ever made: viewing after viewing, it never stops being impressive, and words are nearly useless to describe the impact it still has on the audience.

George Lucas basically took a medieval story and moved it to a distant galaxy, on weird and fascinating planets. Almost everything is taken from the Middle Ages: there are knights, sword-fighting, evil Empires, unsatisfied people who want to overthrow the system, beautiful princesses waiting to be rescued...

Then we've also got speeders, light-sabers, peculiar (and, in the case of Jabba the Hutt, disgusting) creatures, the Death Star, and of course the Force, that fascinating energy which is supposed to bring balance to the galaxy.

The cast is a gas, both the newcomers and the veterans: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford are great as Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo (Ford in particular is hilarious as the arrogant but ultimately nice ""scoundrel""), but the most memorable performance is of course Alec Guinness'portrayal of Obi-Wan Kenobi, the old, wise Jedi who returns one last time to initiate Luke to the mysteries of the Force.

But let's not forget what everybody immediately thinks of when Star Wars is mentioned: Darth Vader. Feared by his opponents as well as his servants, this completely emotionless foe has become the very symbol of Lucas'masterpiece. He's one of those movie-characters people will remember as long as films will keep being made and his unsettling breathing noise still echoes in our memories...

The beginning of a wonderful saga, whose only rival is The Lord of the Rings.

May the Force be with you..."

47. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,10/10,Not just a great movie. It's important,"This story happened 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away'. The galaxy is under the dictatorship of the emperor. Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is part of the rebellion but is capture by the evil Darth Vader. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) the young hero, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) the brigand, his sidekick Chewbacca, and the wise master Jedi Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) must together rescue the princess and save the galaxy.

The characters are icons pulled from classic storytelling like Akira Kurosawa's ""The Hidden Fortress"". George Lucas was able to assemble such iconic characters into a well told story. Rarely is a movie change the nature of movie-making, and even the wider culture. This may be on the list of the most important movie ever. It changed the tone of movies from the gritty morally-confused 70s to the popcorn selling blockbusters that are soon to come.

47. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,9/10,Cinema Classic,"Star Wars is simply a fantastic film, on every level this film is amazing.

Each of the characters in this film are so well developed and so interesting that you just cannot wait for the next scene with them in it, the interactions between the characters us at times tense and at times downright hilarious, leaving no room for boring or lacking dialogue. The particular stand outs in this respect I feel are: Han Solo, the wise cracking bounty hunter with a tendency for arrogance that makes every scene as entertaining as possible. Secondly there is Darth Vader, who is the optometry of cool, scathing evil who poses as the ultimate villain.

Surprising to me, the cinematography and special effects have held up all this time. Although there are some minor issues, one particularly notable one is during the scene where Luke is training with the training droid aboard the Millennium Falcon there are a few frame skips where Luke extends and contracts his lightsaber. Other than this though, the cinematography and special effects are amazing to have held up, particularly the shots of the Empire's space fleet moving through space which are absolutely stunning.

One of the things that absolutely makes this film for me is the magnificent score, composed by John Williams. This score, while being one of the most iconic scores of all time, manages to make every single scene, fitting the mood of the scene perfectly.

The story as well is fantastic, there is never a dull moment; every second of it an absolute thrill ride. Whether its the attack on the Death Star or the Cantina of Mos Eisley the story takes you through the twists and turns of this classic space opera.

If I could recommend one sci-fi adventure film to someone, it would be this, it's an absolute must see.

47. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,10/10,Just plain fun!,
47. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,6/10,A great movie - for its time,
47. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,10/10,A long time ago in a childhood not too far away...,"Princess Leia is captured and held hostage by the Imperial Army as it seeks to rule the Galactic Empire. An old Jedi Knight by the name of Ben ""Obi-Wan"" Kenobi may just be hers, and the rebels only hope. Teaming up with farm boy Luke Skywalker, scoundrel Captain Han Solo, and a couple of quirky droids, Kenobi sets off on a mission that could well shape the destiny of the Galaxy, and all who dwell within it.

Back in 1977 I was but a wee 11 year old boy, weened on films from all genres by my movie loving parents, I had no idea that Star Wars was to have the same impact on me as Jaws had two summers previously, where yet again I found myself queueing around the block for two whole hours to see a film in a one screen theatre. My love of cinema firmly cemented, Star Wars was the start of a love affair that lasts to this very day.

As the years have rolled by and my love of cinema has taken on more in-depth and serious tones, I have come to realise that Star Wars proves to be a far from flawless picture. Certainly its detractors do point to some frayed acting and call the plot structure a jazzed up good versus evil axis, while the charge of George Lucas referencing many prior pictures most assuredly stands, but really do those things matter? No they do not, because Star Wars opened up a new world of cinema, something of a portal to youngsters such as I, it got people talking and debating about the merits of model work in films (which is of an extraordinary high standard here), it nudged film makers to explore being bigger and bolder in their approach, and crucially, above all else, it got film goers hungry again, a hankering for more please if you may. Now it has to be said that all that followed 20th Century Fox's historic blockbuster didn't run with the baton, in fact most pale into comparison on impact value, but for better or worse (depending on the discerning viewers peccadilloes), Star Wars stands as a bastion of adventure laden entertainment.

It is by definition one of the most successful films in history, George Lucas perhaps didn't know it at the time, but in what was to become an almost operatic anthology, he didn't just make a movie, he created a whole new world seeping with style and rich texture. Almost as amazing as the success of the series, is how it has become part of modern day pop culture, anything from religion to everyday speak has at some time or another referenced Lucas' baby. Ultimately, though, it's one single thing that made (and still does make) Star Wars so great, it's that it has the ability to lift the audience into a rousing united feel good cheer; and that is something that few films can ever lay claim too. In 1977 it was an awe inspiring event to watch in the theatre, now here in my middle age it's an event that is like hugging a dear old friend, a friend that I know will never ever let me down no matter how many times I turn to it. 10/10"
47. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,10/10,From the Lucasian Chair of Entertainment - a masterpiece,"I first saw this film on a warm March Sunday evening in 1978, after queueing for a whole hour to get into the cinema. Oh, the anticipation! The excitement! The magic! And here was a film that changed the whole concept of cinema forever, for no matter how many times I return to it, in the flickering dark of the cinema, or the wondrous, glittering DVD release, or in where the film really scores - at the centre of my imagination, that night will live forever in my memory. ANYTHING was possible, wonders could be achieved. Miracles in the here and now. And how lucky I was to share in it.

To the squares that loathe it - I pity you daddyos; you'll never experience what millions of us have felt these past three decades. Go and see Henry Jaglom again; I'll stick with Mr. Lucas - he is THE MAN!

I love this film. Forget what flaws it has - minor they are indeed. Star Wars has become a mystic myth and that sorcerer supreme, Jedi master George Lucas, has given me more pleasure than I can measure. My favourite bit? Almost impossible to choose. Okay, if I must...the stunning Tie Fighter battle with the Millennium Falcon, a work or art in the editing room. It should be hung on a wall somewhere.

George, old chap, if you're ever passing my house please knock - and I'll make you a cup of tea. You deserve that much at least!"
47. Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,10/10,the landmark space fantasy,"what can you say about his movie.it set the bar by which all movies to come would be judged,and this was 1977.i'm talking about the visual effects,which were nothing less than astounding.it still stands up well to any movie in that regard.remember,they didn't have the benefit of CGI back then,so they relied on miniatures.when you add to that,a compelling story and a soon to be iconic villain(not to mention,the colourful cast of characters)and you have box office gold.sure,the dialogue may be wooden and stilted at times,but that is overshadowed by the achievement of the film.Besides,the film was marketed at 12 year olds,so they're not gonna care about stupid things like dialogue.The original ""Star Wars"" or as it is subtitled ""a New Hope,was a landmark film and single handedly reinvented the science fiction genre. Obviously 10/10
